1,"I was once a kind romantic who strove to help anyone who asked. I never felt sorry for myself, I believed in humanity. However, all this was fake, surrogate friendship and some kind of incomprehensible relationship. The girl who swore that she loved, eventually cheated and went to another. Another did not appear - I am hopeless, but simply, without sufficient income and my own housing. Parents with schizophrenia (F20.2) I have never been supported or supported by anyone. So, giving a piece of myself to everyone, I have already lost my spiritual warmth, I became indifferent, apathy. The ex-girlfriend effortlessly found a new one, who immediately married her and takes her to different countries of the world. Of course, I took on any job to show that it was not worse, but I was often deceived - underpaid or not paid at all. I am a simple loser who has lost the meaning of life. Even my appearance does not save my situation - it is terrible (just a freak), therefore I often envy those who are lucky with their appearance, how they are loved and how everything is easy for them. I do my favorite thing, but I often think that no one needs it, just like me, all this is in vain, meaningless. It affects the emptiness inside me. It is often surprising how lucky many people are, how they have it all, and why nothing works out for me, why everything turns out somehow wrong - either they will lose my documents, or they will not pay me exactly, then it is my place that will be closed, it is me used and abandoned, I have such parents. Sometimes I want everyone around me to be in my place, to feel all this for themselves and understand what it is like, but even deeper I just want to stop it all, just interrupt my existence.",
1,"! I wake up every day thinking why am I living? My life is empty and meaningless! I have neither a husband, nor children, nor even a relationship, some kind of hopeless, total loneliness that does not end in any way, all my attempts to get to know someone do not end in anything, I try to do something, but nothing comes of it, I flounder , floundering, but things are not moving forward, I understand and realize that this is how it will be, and the older I get, the worse! And do not say how to occupy yourself, distract yourself, tried, does not help. Because of all these experiences, my health has fallen, I sleep badly, I practically do not eat anything, maybe it’s better, I will slowly die, further existence is meaningless! I'm just taking someone else's place.",
1,"I have problems with my girlfriend. I cannot bear every quarrel. It's very difficult for me. I want to die, but I understand that I cannot do this, as I will hurt my family and friends. I am always to blame. I am dull a lot, I forget a lot. I try to get it right, but again and again I fall on the same rake. There was another situation in which I was already planning when to commit suicide. Before the new year, but again I could not. And in this situation, not only I alone was to blame, but also my other half.",
1,"My whole life is one continuous hell, in which I burn constantly. I'm tired, I don't understand what I did wrong and to whom. Why is all this happening. My father died when I was 7. I spent all my childhood without a father, whom I really missed.",
1,"I want to sleep and not wake up. Every day the same thing. For some time I considered myself cool, I had friends, I studied for grades, I had an ordinary life, like everyone else. But on March 15, 2017, I didn’t feel important, I wanted to take time off from the lesson, but they didn’t allow me, after school I got into an accident and received an open fracture of my right leg (lower leg), my wound was sewn up and my bones were evenly trimmed. On April 11, I underwent an operation (they put the plate on). On April 30, I was sent to be treated at home. Everything was not bad. In the fall I walked on my feet, but my leg began to fester, and in the winter they removed the plate and I wore a plaster. In the spring I wore a plaster cast, but for some reason the bone was twisted, the doctor said it needed to be trimmed. At this time, I did not go to school, my parents at school were told that they could leave me for the second year, I did not want to stay and started walking in April. But the bone was still crooked. In the summer, when I printed a diagnosis of chronic ostemelitis, I had depression. By September I had to go to school, I walked with a cast and with a cane everyone looked at me like a monkey in a zoo. And I noticed that my friends began to shy away from me, but it didn't bother me, I began to study better and devote more time to studying. Now the bone is still crooked, I straighten it out, but in one place of my leg the plaster was rubbed with mazol and there it began to fester. I have depression again, I no longer want to live, there is no one desire to continue life, my parents and relatives said that everything will pass over time, maybe even in the future I will not remember this and I can start all over again, how to start over if I have a huge scar on the whole leg. Now I think that the best I did not suffer and died that day. If I died, I would not suffer now. But my parents said that everything was my own fault. I try not to show my suffering to my parents, I didn't ask too much from my parents and I didn't tell my thoughts (about death) because they will worry and even think that I am thinking about suedcide. I pray to god, maybe I have sinned? My aunt said if it festers for so long, I can stay without a leg, I don't even want to think about it",
1,". I am a mother of a disabled child of 6 years. Zprr, autistic traits, hyperactivity, can just scream for hours, can break and destroy, etc. Until now, he walks in his pants 10 times a day, he began to smear it on the floor. I just became his slave, all desires must be fulfilled, we can bake a cake at 1 in the morning, walk all day when I have a high temperature and fall off my feet, otherwise there will be a nightmare. Constant tantrums, does not go to the garden, shouts. Alone with him all day. The husband is there, but he works, rests after work. She quit her job 2 years ago, my son was often ill, and I have to go to classes and doctors. I have no strength, I'm tired. I wake up in the morning already tired, I fall asleep in the hope of not waking up. I'm tired of everything. Sometimes I even hate him. Sometimes I pull myself together, but his tantrums just break me. I also have an adult daughter, a grandson, but I do not have enough for them. An appeal to God, a paid psychologist, a hairdresser, rare walks while he is in class, aroma baths with oils, a new dress, a trip to a cafe, embroidery, hobbies, sex and everything that is advised usually does not help, I do not want anything. There is no opportunity to receive treatment from specialists. The son goes only where he sees fit, in another case, hysteria. And there is no one to leave him. The husband became a completely stranger, began to drink. Thank you for not leaving the family at all and working. I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Health also began to fail. I live in constant fear. I'm afraid my son will start hysterical, I'm afraid my husband will start screaming because of his son's hysteria. I'm afraid of others with their negativity. But besides the child, I have to serve my husband, he is not even able to pour tea for himself, cook deliciously, clean up, he does not tolerate a mess. I must help my daughter and mother-in-law, sometimes other relatives, must help neighbors so that they do not suffer from the screams of my child. Recently, the son poked his finger at the girl slightly. My mother screamed that I should never leave him at all, And why should I look good so as not to injure completely strangers, although to be honest, there is neither desire nor strength to go to the shower. I am generally silent about the fact that I should be a good mother and grandmother. This is when she managed to owe so much to the whole world in her 40 years. I'm tired of it. In my head there are only thoughts of suicide. The only thing that restrains me is that I have not figured out how to do it for sure.",
1,"I started communicating with a foreigner a month ago. Everything was going great (he's Chinese) but then he started blackmailing. He photographed my face to body voice and was going to send it out. In return, I wanted not money, but communication on the camera. I thought it was okay, but then he made screenshots from there and began to blackmail more, threatening if I did not show him the upper body with the face, he would send it. Now he is blackmailing that he will send if I do not show the whole body. I am hysterical, my classmates came up today and said ""we have your naked photos"" and I left school. I can't go back there, I can't tell my parents. I feel bad. I want to die. He is not talking to him, but it seems to me that he is lying ... what should I do .. ignore does not help. Nothing helps.",
1,"I'll start from the beginning, I have a mother, she has a very bad relationship, because her stepfather left, she blames me for everything, so the relationship with her is generally bad, there is a bra, a sister, sometimes they only need me when they need something or to just sit with the children. There are no friends, there are only acquaintances and they are not interested in my state, that I am, that I am not, there are days when I am glad that I exist, but this is once a year, and that is not always. I have a person whom I love, everyone tells me that he uses me, but I don’t believe, his friends tell me that he doesn’t need me, but I don’t believe, they say he slept with all my acquaintances (almost) and after that he started to doubt him, but all the same, I even defend him in front of myself, it turns out it's true, sometimes I love him, but I don't want to live like that, it won't be better for me than I will suffer so much. My studies are bad, I'm in the 9th grade, here I could not pass mathematics in 4 retakes, as a result, the second year, all plans were canceled (even such simple ones) in general, how can you commit suicide? I don’t want to live, there’s no point in being here, it’s better that I wasn’t there and that I couldn’t feel anything.",

1,This year has been very difficult ....,
1,"I'm 23. I'm a mom and a student. I have been living with my daughter and her father in a rented apartment for 2 years. This year is so difficult and eventful for me that it is possible to move. But now I completely neglected to study. I cannot Ri open the book, nor can I even bring myself to wash the dishes. I don't want anything at all. I just don't want to wake up anymore. It's so hard to live and breathe every day. I do not want to exist, but I understand that by my death I will bring grief to my loved ones. I am completely confused in life.",
1,"It all started after the New Year holidays. For the first time, I was admitted to the hospital with acute pain. They revealed a small ulcer (healed at the moment) and a sharp increase in blood sugar to 12.5. Prescribed a diet. My mother, ""saying my grandmother treated me like that,"" gave me everything except what is included in her. Since then, I almost constantly experience pain in the right hypochondrium, and in recent months, it is stronger, sharp and radiating to the rib and shoulder. There were a couple (GERD chronic pancreatitis) diagnoses that were not confirmed. Celiac disease, a gluten tolerance disorder, is now questionable. Because of the increase in sugar, they put on type 2 diabetes, but the sugars behave very strange. That is about 5, then in a couple of weeks 7.5 per lean. I don't follow Diet 9. Now I try to eat 5. Besides, there is a complete lack of understanding on the part of my relatives (especially my mother). I had to not even take medications (including painkillers) in order not to quarrel with her. In general, my life turned into hell. Suicidal thoughts often arise, but what stops here is that everything will get much worse.",
1,", I am 24 years old. I am a very unhappy and lonely person, so I am writing here. Since childhood, I was very trusting, vulnerable and naive, my mother protected me from everything and overly took care of me, when my father, on the contrary, was very strict, drank and beat my mother. I always saw how my mother tolerates his betrayal and beatings and imperceptibly preserved this image of the relationship for herself. My father was not ashamed of anything, when he was angry, I got it too, and he also told me from childhood that when I grow up I will have to obey a man so that I have a lot of money. When I was 16 years old, my father left us, relations with him did not work out. I changed dramatically, I had a new friend, at first she was so sweet, but then she began to get me drunk, and then spread nasty things about me throughout the school, she also took advantage of the fact that I was also going through a breakup with the guy who left me. Then, when I entered college, I came to my senses a little, began to study well, but even there I had a bad friend, with whom I quietly started drinking, but here terrible things began to happen to me. Once I got drunk to such a state that I did not know where I was, and some guy came to my friend, who eventually raped me, and as I found out later he paid my friend for it. 4 years have passed since then, I have not seen these people again. But for the last couple of months, I have been gnawing at feelings of shame, guilt, and self-loathing for allowing myself to lead such a prodigal lifestyle. After all, if I slept at home, nothing would have happened! I am writing here, because I have no one to share with, I stopped trusting people, I have apathy, in my head all the time these pictures from the past. I really want to cry to my mother, but she does not even suspect, she is sure that I am pristine and had no problems with alcohol. Suicidal thoughts began to come to me, as I am afraid to live on with such a load of dirt that I went through. I regret not being able to do otherwise in the past, now I cannot forgive myself.",
1,"chronically ""unlucky"". Since childhood, I have a black streak. In the courtyard, they mocked and called names, at school they ignored and harassed, could not do anything, was a weakling, was often ill, sat at home, read books, did hand-to-hand fighting in 9th grade, became a little stronger, but started his studies and did not go to college, in the end went to college (economics), was called a nerd in college for 3 years, even the teachers made fun of, somehow graduated. 5 years at home, I read books and watch movies, I can't get a job, although I already have a little experience I worked as a janitor in the camp, I wanted to be a counselor - they didn't take it, again bad luck, they take others, but I got a job. , I didn't work with the boss, I don't know where to go now ... my parents say go and study, but I can't, I have no strength, and it's late already at 28, I don't know what I want in life, there is no goal, there is some kind of emptiness around, everyone is running somewhere, in a hurry, fussing, I just do not fit into this life, awkward, slow, everyone kicks me, tired of me ...",

I study and work, but everything is difficult. Suicidal thoughts are calming. I just don't know what to do with it, because it only gets worse. There are no friends, there are friends. There is no relationship, I think, partly due to the fact that I have a complete lack of sex drive. And I can’t love anyone either (I think this is also normal in the absence of self-esteem). Nobody died for me, nothing bad happened. Before there was a normal guy, there were friends and girls.",

1,"Yes,  everyone. Also everything is very sad. All my life I depend on games. Before, when there were las vegas slot machines igoal, there were problems and debts, but not the same as now. When they were closed I did not play for about five years, probably. Then I found out. about online casinos and started playing. The debts were not big, but they were. Now there is a lot of debt. How to live on I don’t know. As well as everything a million times swore and still there. The aunt took over 350,000. I thought I’ll not play everything, I’ll pay. A month later I climbed up again, and then again and again. In general, there are about 800 thousand debts in a loan, and even microloans I scored 60,000 and interest is dripping there. My wife knows about half of the debts. I’m already at the limit. For about a year I have been playing continuously. I’ve already drawn everyone into my bondage. I'm tired of crying, I have bad thoughts in my head. How will they react if I’m not there. I’ve probably been drinking a sedative for a year. I’m thin, well, in short, a drug addict. My mother’s blood pressure rises if she doesn’t survive to find out about some debts. The salary is about 70. I pay 35,000 loans, so far. I don’t understand how to be what to do.

Grandma did the same with me. My father is an alcoholic and I got it all the time for this, she insulted me every day, constantly kicked me out of the house, shouted that I should be the best student and that I have no right to make mistakes. My father scored on me. I have never received support and love from him. He is the most indifferent person I know. Mom fell into religion and became a fanatic, I have no problems with God, I believe in him, but I can't talk to her in any way because any of her Advice comes down to the fact that I must pray and believe. I tried to go to a psychologist, spent 2.5 years and a lot of money, but I don't like the result. Situations from the past haunt me in one way or another. There is no strength to endure. Constantly thinking about suicide",
1,"The whole life seems to be complete delirium. When I was little, my parents worked abroad. And I lived anywhere - with my grandmother, with my aunt, that is, I was not particularly needed by anyone and no one was involved in education. Mom returned, we became very close, we were best friends, and dad stayed to work. When I was 8, my younger sister was born, everyone immediately fell in love with her, I hated her. None of my relatives paid special attention to me and I hardly spoke to my mother. Mom loved reading my correspondence, threatening friends. It hurt a lot, but no one seemed to notice it. In the 5th grade, Mom fell ill with cancer. At 6, I fell in love for the first time, love turned out to be mutual, but I considered myself too little + because of my mother I was upset and cut off the connection with that guy. I went into equestrian sports, he helped me recover spiritually, but I had to quit. This depressed me even more. In 2016, dad came, we all lived together. At the beginning of the 9th grade, I again began to communicate with that guy (I still loved him), we began to ""date"". Although this relationship was like a kindergarten - we always fought, did not even kiss (I was very afraid). He was constantly jealous of me, once he pushed me into the fountain out of jealousy (although I never gave a reason). But I was glad that he was with me. We began to get closer to my mother, we could talk with her for hours, I made friends. Our first kiss with that guy was when we were together for 10 months already. On August 11, 2017, my mother died, it was very hard for me, they took me to the hospital. He then began to climb to me very much, even bought condoms, inclined me to sex .. Then again a scene of jealousy, he called me names in every possible way as he could, hit me .. Blood, tears, we parted, I went back to the hospital. Since then, I have been afraid to strike up relationships with guys. I miss my mom wildly. I still have a younger sister, my mother said to take care of her, but I cannot. I was always lazy and it was hard to do something. After my mother's death, I do not want to see anyone, hear, I can not leave the house for a month. At home, chaos, our dishes may not be washed for more than a week, everywhere srach. I would very much like to deal with this all, put things in order, become a good sister, daughter. But I can not. I can’t bring myself to do something. I just want to die. There's no one to even talk to, it's a shame. Dad constantly says that it is hard for him after the death of his mother, he has problems, and that I whine. He thinks that I have a very cool life and only he has problems.

1,"Recently, more and more thoughts of suicide began to appear. Now my main problem, which oppresses and makes me think about leaving, is possible blindness. Vision deteriorates, doctors only shrug their shoulders, eye diseases are not one and one disease clings to another. You start to treat one, you can harm the other. Doctors recommend waiting to the limit and when it becomes very bad and there is nowhere to go, then proceed to active actions and operations. Because of these problems, I am constantly in myself, I have no personal life. I do not want to be a burden to someone if trouble comes. It is difficult to get a job, because for medical reasons I can't do much. There are no relatives, no friends in the good sense of the word either. I have no one to help if I go blind. I do not count on our government. And most importantly, I don't want to live blind. I don't want to suffer. I could adapt to such a life, but I don't want to. I have a different character. Therefore, I am now at the crossroads and have become very thoughtful about what to do. I am an unbeliever and I do not believe in all this nonsense with hell, heaven, but at the same time, I do not want to leave myself. And I understand that trouble will come, I will get rid of such a life and this, too, will most likely be a death sentence.",

My story began with my hobby for online casinos, at first my salary was enough to replenish my gaming account, then I took loans and credits, recouped, closed a part and again all over again, and after I started stealing money at work, I removed large sums using my position, I lost everything to zero, and now the phone is being torn apart by collectors, at work the bosses began to suspect something was wrong, all the gold that I had was handed over to the pawnshop, while no one knows about this problem, but apparently this is not for long, yet a little bit and everything will be revealed, I hate myself, I hate for everything that I have done, for the way I framed everyone around, I am afraid to imagine what will happen when everyone finds out about everything, I can’t bear it, I don’t want to see it, I I don’t want to live, there’s no man, no debts, I’m so tired of this aimless life, I’m so tired of waking up every morning from the calls of the collectors and living in eternal lies and fear, I understand that it’s all my own fault, and there’s probably only one way out to nowhere",
1,I can not take it anymore,
1,"Hey. My name is Nastya. I am 13 years old. If there are mistakes, then I'm sorry I'm from Ukraine and I don't know Russian. Everyone says that I am only 13 and I can't have problems. I'm tired of living. I'm tired. I don't want to live like this. Mom is drinking. Dad drinks too. Help nothing. I live with my grandparents. Grandma is always not happy with my grades. I try as best I can. I am the best student in the class. I always come home before 18:00. I always help around the house. I have almost no friends. There are friends and classmates. But I hate them. I had a friend too, Nastya. At 13, she slept with a guy since grade 11. Walks until 5 am. I stopped communicating with her. Sonia was also a friend. But she also walked and drank at night. We also have a boy named Dima in our class. He constantly annoys me with his vulgar jokes. Sometimes I feel like crying, I feel lonely. I don't want to live. Whatever happens at home, it's always my fault. We have a Pikinesse dog. His name is Marik. Grandfather loves him more than anyone. I'm serious. He calls him son. When we eat, he eats borsch himself, and gives meat to Marik. I'm running errands. Do that, do that, bring it, give it, go don't bother. I'm a little plump. And my aunt always offends me. Says you take up a lot of space or the like. I tried to run, I try not to eat a lot, but I can't. My grandfather also says that I only think about guys, but that's not true. When we go to visit someone with relatives, he says that Nastya said she was going to get married. She can't read, but she's getting married. This is so maddening. I read a lot, when I said that I would stay in the library, my grandfather told you just to climb. I have a brother. He was given a tablet for 6 years. He broke it for a month. He stood with his feet on one end and took hold of the other with his hands and bent it. They buy him expensive toys and clothes. He is my cousin. My grandmother gave birth at 15. She has 3 children in total. The eldest Tolya, my middle dad, and my younger aunt. When we were sitting in the kitchen with my aunt, she said it would be better if your dad died and not Tolya. Nobody loves me. Nobody needs me. My grandmother told me that she didn't like going to the boarding school. I don't even have my own room. The three of us live in the same apartment. When I left school, I met two classmates. One threw a squeezed pack of cigarettes in my face, and they laughed together. Then the next day I spoke to them, they were silent. It was in front of everyone. Everyone thought that he was good, he is not silent, he will stand up for himself. But this is just with them. I wanted to cry with resentment. Take-all. Eternal reproaches. On August 30th I am 14 years old. I would so much like a holiday. But I know that nothing will happen. They will again say that I will not go through the door soon. I weigh 50 kg. I think that's a lot. I eat once a day. I think I'll lose a little bit of weight. Sometimes I really want to tell everyone how I hate them.",

I chose the economic sphere, although a complete zero in mathematics. I'm only in my first year, of course it's not too late to change my specialty, but I'm afraid how my parents will react. From the group I communicate with only one girl. I'm very tight-lipped. It's not difficult for me to get to know each other, but for some reason I can't communicate with them after they met. I speak very quietly. I try to speak louder with all my might, but nothing works. It's not because of shyness or self-doubt. But simply, physically I cannot speak louder. I study in another city, far from home. I am very sad because I miss my family and school friends. My whole life is crumbling. Feeling like I'm stuck in a dead end and don't even know how to get out of it. I want to communicate freely with everyone and not feel so lonely. But I don't even know how. For the past few years, there is no desire to live. I was open and sociable as a child. And now she is very closed in herself and I don't even know how to fix it all. I can't even communicate well with my family. I feel superfluous and unnecessary. Has become very vulnerable. Any word can hurt me. Moreover, I have poor posture. The neck protrudes forward. It looks awful. There is no time to fix all this. The study is too hard and there is simply not enough time. Sometimes I think about what I have turned my life into. I would like to die, but I'm afraid to do this. I want to cry out loud, but I can't even do that, since I live in a university dormitory. I am ashamed to go to a psychologist.

They ate scrambled out. my father yelled that I was a fool and applied to the medical faculty. Scandals began with him, he intimidated that ""he would turn off the tap."" The mother did not interfere. All his life he beats her, humiliates her. She bore him 4 children and says that because of us she cannot leave him. I hate myself for her torment. Then I left to study, my father put my brother and me in a small one-room apartment, and so the nightmare began ... It's like a cage from which there is no exit or I just can't see it. Parents called home and God forbid I was not at home after 6. My brother beat and humiliated him, but in the 3rd year he finally demolished the tower. He was jealous of all the guys, yelled why I needed someone, if there was one, he stuck like a bath leaf, my clothes seemed defiant to him, he was angry that I was talking with friends, hit on the head, pushed hard, that I fell to the floor , threw things in the face. All these 3 years I cried to my mother, asked for help. She did not interfere. After the 3rd course, when I failed all the exams, blew the roof off, I cursed my mother, shouted that she had abandoned me, she did not let me go, I pushed her hard and even hit her hand. Now our every conversation turns into a scandal. I do not understand what is happening to me, my mother with her last words, I roar. They did not resettle my brother, they said that there was no money and ""close the hook on him"", I cannot go into the kitchen, drink tea, because he is there. I confessed, my father said that I would commit suicide if I did not urgently take up my mind. I love my mother, but her mother with terrible words, in the summer she grabbed my hand, I tried to unhook, she did not let go, and then she pressed so hard that something cracked. I want to die.

There are no forces and aspirations. I thought that love, family would give some kind of incentive, but this is stupidity. In short, I am without money, incentive, appearance and a loner all my life.

When I came home, I hoped that tomorrow I would be good friends with someone, and there are girls more or less similar to me. But it was not there, everyone had already organized themselves into their own ""groups"", and in each I would have been superfluous. I seem to communicate well with everyone, but I'm not directly friends, and I was sitting alone. It never really scared me and I adhered to the rule ""it's better to be alone than to run after the herd and humiliate yourself."" But I realized that it would be difficult on my own, because I study very badly, I barely passed the OGE, there was a retake, and with someone it’s easier, at least you can scare yourself, and ask for help and it’s not so scary. Okay, okay, here started the topics about exams, sessions, tests, etc. I was convinced for the hundredth time that I wouldn’t hand it over, and if they were expelled, I won’t forgive, so they rely on me at home and pay big money, and I felt boots and always knew that I was not worthy of all this (self-esteem was almost always underestimated). There is no desire to learn, to go there too, and there is no one to share with anyone. Friends say, ""How did you want? I thought everything was so simple, sit there and teach, they still somehow give up, take their heads."" But I'm not one of those, I can't sit down and learn. Even if a miracle happens, I will forget everything the next day. I honestly want to work, maybe I will regret it, because I don't know all the ""charm"" of adulthood.

And in response, ""No, and I was also sitting alone,"" most likely upset her and barely finished, as her voice was trembling and tears were visible. Even when I was writing this moment, I cried.

I'm a neurotic-perfectionist-idealist and all my life I live according to the principle of ""all or nothing"", I try to give my all, but life is not like that, from this I dive in constant depression, maybe it is not possible to live ideally and as if I do not live my life, the way out of which was always the same and stupid alcohol. Recently, I have been going through a very difficult moral period - I lost my career, three small children in my arms (this even more worn out my psyche and nervous system) lack of support, lack of money - I have neither parents nor brothers-sisters ... I have no friends and friends, I have become a completely antisocial element - it's hard for me to communicate with people, I buried deep in myself and my problems ... it seems to me that no one understands me, my psyche has been broken since childhood and my self-esteem has been killed, they also humiliate me from time to time, no help from nowhere, I pull on myself like a horse and worry about the future, neurotic, in a word ... from this I bury myself deeper and deeper morally, including alcohol ... the last time I got so drunk, maybe it was so bad the last year I live like on a powder keg and a situation happened that just ""finished off"" me, my bubble of patience burst, I was very humiliated and betrayed by seemingly close people, I did a lot of ugly things, half of which I don't even remember ( drank from grief nights I’m on the street until the morning with some first meeting company) - what I did and did I don’t remember anything, anyway someone from the people saw me, but I’m a “decent” girl in life, a mother of three children ... even scary to the street and ashamed to go out, this makes the depression even stronger. I'm afraid that somewhere I'll meet these people who watched me in this state, it's a wild shame ... I'm scared to leave the house ... I realized my mistakes and problems with alcohol, like that in a stupid way, in a masculine manner ( I never had help and support and behaved like a kid all my life) I tried to ""solve"" problems for many years and reached the extreme point of alcoholism and shame ... I don't know how to live with it, daily panic attacks, fear and shame, I don’t want to live, how to live with such a burden of the past and shame (I remember all my “adventures” of many years on the blue shop) ... only children stop, how they will be without me, she grew up without parents and childhood was difficult and terrible , which broke my psyche ...

It seems to me that I interfere with others, that I cannot be of interest to them - and, as a result, I am afraid of being too annoying. I really want to believe people, and I do - especially when they tell me that I am a nonentity. This is what my mother repeats to me for any reason, some teachers at school and college said this, I sometimes heard this in individual master classes. Six years ago I wrote poetry, wrote songs for voice and guitar, arranged them, performed them solo and with other people. Now I am afraid to sing and play in public. Somehow, after five years of calm, I was able to return to writing prosaic miniatures - but I do not feel any satisfaction or pride in this regard.

And attempts to help oneself end in an even greater breakdown. I have no one to tell about this - my mother will not listen, the rest of the relatives are less close, and the only person from whom I can receive love and affection, which I don’t need to try to earn, I am afraid to load. Before meeting him, I had lived with a stone heart for more than a couple of years and no people bothered me, but this meeting again broke me.

Recently I began to think that I am a mistake of nature; it would have been better if I had not been born, or even be born as a different person by other people, but because my relatives passed on the fact that I stutter and character too.

And nothing can be done. It remains only to wait for death and heal. What's the point? I'm only 20. I won't have time to do anything. I can hardly give birth, and the children will be left without a mother. And what kind of personal life is there, if three years, every other day, I need to get injections, from which I feel very bad. And there are no other options. Can I not be treated and die faster? Well, I will live through these 10 years of torment, and still die. And I can die in 3 years without torturing myself with injections. The only thing is that my mother will not let me do this, probably. But I see no reason to live on.",

I almost never supported my parents when they were bad and did not help them. And they always helped me. Now that I think about it it hurts me a lot. Some of my peers mock me.

1,"! My situation is probably not quite simple. My loved one died over a year ago. All our adult lives we were together, planning a child. After talking with his parents, I decided on eco, material from his brother. Neither he nor my parents were against it. The meaning of life appeared for me, because I thought that I would die, before that I had never thought about suicide. The puncture attempt was unsuccessful, no eggs were received. But I waited for the body to stabilize to try again. And now about 3 months have passed, I am ready to run to the doctor, his brother flew to visit after school, but his parents refused to use my brother in a mild form, so to speak, since I need to build my life, career, try to abstract myself from death beloved, etc. I have no right to ask for a brother, He has his own life, a girl, a magistracy. But I again began to think about suicide, this thought is obsessive, The meaning of life was taken away from me. I can't do the procedure on the donor's material, I wanted exactly the genetic material of my brother, for me it is psychologically important, as if it were a child from my beloved. Now I am completely devastated, the birth of a child was for me the meaning of my future life. It was like I wasted this time after his death, I had changes in eating behavior, severe weight loss, insomnia after his death, but the decision to have a child changed everything, I recovered for this. I cannot talk about this with my relatives, conversations like a young beautiful, you meet, give birth, I can not stand it already. Stops, like everyone else, probably only the fear of pain and the fear of being disabled if nothing works out. I want to see my beloved, only he understood me. Today I could not sleep for half the night, there was a wild desire to just commit suicide <ed. Mod.>, Stopped by the fact that the cat was in the apartment. I went to a specialist, the result was zero. Help please, I don't know how to deal with this.",

It is very difficult to communicate with people, I don't know what to talk about, it seems that they are completely uninterested in me and communication with me is a burden. This is partly due to my appearance (too big nose and ugly smile). I try to look attractive, always wearing makeup, but it doesn't help much. I have never had a relationship. I have no idea that I will ever be able to meet mutual love. This makes me feel defective, worse than others. Even if I suddenly get to know someone, they will probably consider this situation abnormal. All people have something interesting happening in their lives, and I don't even have anyone to go anywhere. There are a couple of girlfriends, but they also rarely manage to meet, they all have their own lives. Every evening, coming after work, I feel such emptiness that I do not want to live.

I don't know how to find friends, find love, the meaning of life. It happens that for the whole day I will not say a word to anyone, since no one is around. I'm even scared to go out alone.

1,", my name is Natalia. I believe in God, I pray and he helps me a lot. But over the past 2 years I was so tired mentally and physically, emotionally I just burned out. In December 2016, I was diagnosed with cancer in one of the private clinics in our city, I did not believe it. Endless analyzes began, histology checks that did not show it, and the doctors as one kept repeating that I had cancer, a change of clinics, a change of specialists, after each histology the tumor increased and I saw it perfectly, but no one else took care of me except for cancer , we just said we don't know what it is then. My husband went to Moscow with me there, they also threw up their hands and said we see right away, but if it's cancer, then it's already at the last stage 3 or 4. no, this is not 100% cancer. The lymph node got out and sent for a commission in 2 cancer centers, they put cancer of the 3rd stage with metamtase in the limo node. Further more fun, they said that they were mistaken and that the resorption of the glass turned out to be not a limo node but a cyst, and they sent me to be treated to ordinary doctors. But they are not taken. So they don't really know and are afraid of the second and the most important ones, my health was very shaken, emotionally unstable, I started having problems with my heart, blood pressure, stomach, and so on. See you soon. But I understood the reason and could no longer live like this, swallowing handfuls of pills that only make me worse, since the tumor is in place and no one knows how to treat it. Doubts began whether it was a problem or a problem. Cancer or not cancer, and so I got to thinking that's all. I don't want to live like this anymore. I lost my job because of this illness, I cannot work, the issue has not been resolved, and when it will be decided and whether it will be decided at all is not known. Therefore, I fall asleep and wake up now with the thought that I want to die. I'm tired of everything, I ask for help. The cry of despair already. The whole body is out of order from the nerves.

In the midst of the Blue Whale, I tried to attempt suicide <ed. mod.>, but at the moment when I was about to do it, I thought about my parents and could not. Soon, after about 2 weeks, I again returned to these thoughts. To this day, I very much think about suicide, my classmate walked with cut hands for 6 months, I dissuaded her. But when the time came before my life, nothing helps. Once, I was so upset about some little thing that I cried for about 6 hours.

I can no longer live in this hell, inside there is despair, hopelessness, horror, it takes away all my strength, people don’t want to hire me, they say that you have a face as if someone had died. What awaits me ahead is a prison, a garbage dump, and most importantly, what will happen to my son, whom I betrayed. If I don't commit suicide now, someday I will have to.

I felt lonely, unnecessary. And I didn't have the heart to get a divorce, I was frightened by financial insolvency. There are no friends, relatives, relatives, no one who could support with advice, even a kind word. The parents are dead. Two years ago, at work, I met a man who began to show signs of attention, although he himself was married. I got carried away, believed in his love, felt loved, beautiful, and most importantly someone needed ... everything that I did not receive from my husband.

Of course, all the ""love"" of that man evaporated when my husband found out about everything (which is even worse not from me), I lied, made excuses. Everyone condemns me. Most disgusting from myself! I am very guilty before my son and husband. If I behaved somehow differently, would have been wiser in relations with my husband, then there would not have been all these scandals and nagging, the son would have grown up in a calm atmosphere.

No, at first everything was fine, but then I began to feel that this was not all that I didn’t want. It seems that I still have feelings for the past martyr. It gets in the way, confusion in my head. I do not feel particularly warm feelings for other people. It seems that I am tired of living, although I do not live so much. I can't muster my strength and do something elementary. Sometimes you don't have the strength to just wash your face, let alone go out or contact someone. All this has been going on for about a year. I don’t know how I’ll study next academic year, there is no motivation to study, no strength, no desire. Also memory problems. I began to forget everything: my mail, numbers, addresses, some names, instructions, the material covered. I often think about killing myself, but I can't because of my mother, a couple of friends and the martyr. I understand that they will then suffer, suffer. Probably, I will suffer for another 10 years, if I'm lucky, even less. I have absolutely no idea of ​​my future. Maybe I don't have it.",

It seems that from the very birth I was superfluous here, yes, I should have died even when I was born and did not breathe.

It would seem that such a wonderful age, all life is ahead, so much good is waiting, but no. I am waiting for admission to the university and I understand that if I do not enter, then I will simply commit suicide, because I see no reason to live on, because I could not even enter the university! What can I do then? My problems lie in the complexes that I have been so generously rewarded with. Since I am afraid to do the very act that would save me from all the troubles on earth, I smoke and suffer from bulimia in the hope that it will help. People often say that I am very beautiful, smart, funny, almost the best person in their life, but what is the point in that when all my childhood passed like this: everyone who wanted to humiliate me. And it stuck firmly in my young head. I hate myself, my body, my behavior, my habits. Any thing that is somehow connected with me becomes the object of my hatred. I'm tired of living this way. It hurts. This is bad. This is terrible. My biggest fear is to learn that life does not end after death, because I simply cannot stand such mental anguish. My relatives like to say that the most important thing is to constantly occupy yourself with something, but how this can be done when even getting out of bed is a feat for me. More and more often I catch myself thinking that everyone would be so good if I died, no one would suffer, no one would waste their nerves on me. I do not know what to do. I'm so confused. I'm tired of hating my body and hiding it behind a mask of arrogance. Whatever I do, no matter how I lose weight, get better, don't paint, the result is the same - I hate myself. In general, I will be grateful for any advice. I wish you all peace and tranquility in your soul.",

And before that, they planned the child, and the name was chosen. It seems to me that I am incapable of serious family relationships. I read that there are people predisposed to suicide, no matter how well the events in their lives develop, they will ruin everything and suffer. Despite the fact that outwardly I have achieved a lot, I am not really interested in anything, except for a love relationship. I think this also played a significant reason in my mood.

Suicidal thoughts, loneliness, devastation, chaos of thoughts in the head. When chaos reaches its extreme point, there is only emptiness, where there is nothing. I think the brain is shutting down from the overload. There are acquaintances with whom I sometimes see, but this is quite rare and usually not accurate, the postponement of meetings is a normal phenomenon. Throughout my life, there has always been one close friend who is closer to me than my parents. My feeling is that my parents just broke me, suppressed my self in me. Resentment, it seems to me, is because I am not like everyone else, I can’t do something or not do it. When it was necessary to sort out a situation where some grandmother accused me of damaging her flowers, but I did not. At that moment I became a liar. As a result, I cannot adequately communicate with girls, I start to overdo it with vanilla. I have only one friend and I don't understand why he still communicates with me.

I don't know myself, what I want, what I really am. I would like to end this torment, perhaps forever, I do not dare to do so. Hands down from the lack of a result of any search, there is no result.

I'm just a doll that is played and when she gets bored, they throw it away in shabby feelings. I understand that someone will suffer if I die ... but I feel sick. I tried, went to a psychologist and tried to think positively but to no avail. If before I shone and tried to live, now I have faded, darkened, faded.

We turned out to have identical views on life, interests, hobbies, we became close ... both spiritually ... and physically. But he never said that he felt for me. Or rather made it clear that I was not indifferent, but then everything collapsed. He said that he did not see a Woman in me, he could not be my boyfriend and stopped all contact. He also said that I was not satisfied him neither sexually, nor in anything (although, I confess, he was not at his best, but I had no thoughts to humiliate him) He walked past me to the university with a detached look. And if he wrote on the social network, then with such aplomb, as if he was doing a favor, and he also said that he was not in the mood because he could not find a lady to his heart (and I could not cut off the correspondence with him, he again played on my emotions, then disappeared, then appeared. And the same man, who himself admitted that for the first time he met both an intelligent and a beautiful girl with whom he was interested. He said that he was afraid that I would kick him. I was attracted to him: intelligence, charisma and intelligence. Finally, I was happy that I found a person who understands me. 8 months have passed. I experienced severe pain, the first two months roared with smoking, emaciated, turned into a shadow of herself, stopped eating, sleeping, abandoned school, cried almost every day. It was ... hard for me to see a person with whom there were hugs, kisses and everything else, who passed with a stone face. there is also my fault, because I allowed to experience strong feelings. And he hurt with his departure. I hoped until the last that he would return. I saw in him a Personality, Still a good, intelligent and interesting person. And he, it turns out, was just playing with me, my emotions. When everything in his life is with him I still have a terrible apathy (despite the fact that I write poetry, study foreign languages, etc.) I blame myself, because I stopped being interesting to this person, did not show character where necessary was, and quickly got bored. More and more often there are thoughts of suicide, although I know that the fate of the soul will be terrible. I did not need the riches of the world, I just wanted to walk the road of life with this man. He made me devastated: no feelings, there are no more emotions. Only emptiness.

It's very hard for me to overcome this. I found a job, but for now I will earn only a fraction of it, so that to pay off at least 10% of the debt, another 20% will appear.

There is no desire either. for what. I try to be happy, but all around is panic and blackness. The feeling that due to my inability to communicate, I will remain alone. They diagnosed me with deep depression, plus problems. on the joints. In general, I try to get medical treatment, I even took a vacation at the university. But the pills only give a temporary effect.

I am weak, vulnerable, I have weight problems and have no friends. Social phobia is present. I sit at my computer all day, dreaming of becoming an e-sportsman, although I know that it will not shine for me. High school students scoff at me, bully at school, no one takes me seriously. I cannot look at myself in the mirror, my reflection is unpleasant to me. In the sixth grade, my mother pressed very hard and, forgive me for the expression, ""smacked"" me, saying that I have no friends and I am not interested in anyone. All my attempts to lose weight are dwindling, as well as making friends with people. I stopped feeling the passage of time. Every summer day is similar to the previous one, I don't remember what happened in July and early June. Nothing happens, and I don't change anything. I live in my imaginary world, where there is an improved form of me, and that's all. I am only 13 years old, and I have already managed to be disappointed in this life. I really want to change, but when I start thinking about who to do all this for, then tears roll in and I just hug the pillow, which absorbs them. I'm tired of suffering from this loneliness. I ask you to somehow respond. I have weighty thoughts about suicide and it looks like this summer can safely be the last, because I'm just tired of crying. And I was tired of suffering from these problems, because no one even remembers me, and I just don't need anyone.",

1,". I am 36 years old. 3 months ago there was a break in relations with my partner, we lived together for 5 years. She is 11 years younger than me. The initiative to start a relationship came from her. And the gap initiative too. She couldn't explain to me why she was leaving. She said that we are too different people and she was tired of constant scandals. It seems that we agreed to remain friends and colleagues, until I found out that a week after leaving, she had a girl who is 20 years old. And then I, as if I lost my mind. For 3 months now, I have been crying practically incessantly, breaking dishes and drinking alcohol in huge quantities. I write messages to her and her new girlfriend, arrange a showdown. The matter is complicated by the fact that I am the leader of a large vocal pop group. She was the main soloist and has a very friendly relationship with the members. After declaring that I was just a ""sister"" for her, that she did not perceive me as a woman and that the new girl was ""adult, intelligent, sexy and the best!"" tell me that I have no right to mix personal and work. That is, I myself destroyed my team, which I had been creating for 15 years. I think that the main soloists in full force will leave. This whole topic about my wrongness is actively discussed, they openly tell me that I am a crappy leader, if I allowed this whole story to spill out. Now I have cut off all contacts with everyone, changed my phone number, social page. networks. I deleted all contacts so that there was no temptation to call someone on a drunken case or write with a showdown. Now I am absolutely alone with my history. One of the words ""absolutely"", I keep in touch with only one person, because everyone else is somehow connected with my professional activity, and not on my side because of my inappropriate behavior. I fell very low, lost my credibility, the creative team, and with alcohol, almost a human face and dignity. More and more often, suicide seems to be the only way to get rid of. I ask you to.

It all started when my mom got cancer. I was very worried about her health, I did everything in my power. I constantly visited her (although it was very difficult for me, since I study in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and at that time lived in a barracks position), pleased with my studies, in general, I was always there. As a result, by the end of the first year, she died. It was very difficult, but I had my father, younger brother and my beloved girl with me, who gave me the strength to live on. When I was in my second year, my grandfather died, I was also very worried about this period. When I was in my third year, my dad died in a car accident. I started to give up, but my younger brother stopped me, as I realized that he had no one else but me. My father still has big debts, since he was found guilty of an accident and my brother and I will have to answer. My relatives, despite the fact that they promised to help us, forgot about us. I don’t tell my brother anything, because I don’t want him to worry about these problems. I deal with all the problems myself. Now the 4th year, my girlfriend left me, who was a support for me all this time. And now I just got depressed with both ends. I don't want anything anymore. Wherever you go, problems are everywhere. I just burn out from what is happening. There was no one next to me who would understand me. She had another young man. It hurts me even more.

1,"! I ask for help in resolving my situation. The fact is that I have obsessive thoughts about suicide, and they are so ""persistent"" that I recently thought that they are not mine ... They arise, of course, not from scratch and not in a good mood, but they arise abruptly, like a breakdown inside me due to any negative thoughts about my life. Nothing terrible happens in my life, although it is far from ideal, there are many difficulties, but they are all solvable. Only now I don't want to decide anything, I just want not to be. For 2 weeks now, I just lie on the bed all day, only occasionally and with difficulty do the necessary things, but today I realized that I could not even go out for groceries. I am ready to eat nothing, just to do nothing - I have complete apathy for everything. So I started thinking that “someone” or “something” inspires me with these thoughts, and this “something” is in me, because I don't see adequate reasons for their occurrence and suggestion to myself. I believe in otherworldly forces, incl. and dark, and therefore I suspected their presence in me. I understand that those reading now will think that I am mentally ill, and perhaps I am. I want to hear an honest opinion. I want to understand what is happening to me. An inner voice (so far mine) persistently convinces me to commit suicide, and now it has come to the point that I have no will to live, no interest in what was very interesting a month ago. And it is progressing rapidly. And the biggest problem is that I have a child in my arms, with whom I am alone. I feed him the leftovers of food, but I myself no longer eat. No, of course, I will not leave him hungry, only this motivates me to do at least something else in this miserable life. A responsibility. But I have a feeling that I am already a living corpse.

Although she always treated them normally. But it was precisely to lesbian couples that she treated with some disgust. Leafing through photos of handsome guys, actors, I don't feel anything like I used to. Recently, there are many topics on the Internet that all men are stupid, do not respect women, that being with a woman is better. Is it possible that this somehow influenced my perception? What scares me is that looking at the guys that I liked before, I don't feel anything, but looking at the girls I understand that they are beautiful and all sorts of thoughts come into my head. I try to drive them away, but these thoughts are constantly with me. I read a bunch of different articles that this happens in teenagers, but it does not calm me down. In depth, I understand that in the future I want to have a husband, possibly children. But thoughts do not recede. The most frightening thing is that I am walking down the street, I see a handsome guy and I don't feel anything. And I'm afraid of girls like fire. When I see them, I immediately check myself, if I want them, etc. I also read that women at my age realize that they are attracted to girls. Regarding relations with parents: mom and dad are divorced. Divorced when I was still little. My relationship with my father is normal. My relationship with my mother is good. Perhaps due to the fact that we live together, I did not have an example of a family of a man and a woman?

Then I decided to go to a technical school to become a veterinary paramedic, and then at the last moment I got sick.

I have no friends, I am fixated on the fact that I have many complexes. The young man says that he does not want children from me, but at the same time convinces that he loves. You need to put it on your own feet, but I don't want to. Because laziness eats me up. And it is tempting to sit on my mother's neck ashamed. Even now, at the age of 20, it is already a shame to ask my mother for money. I start to get covered with pimples and swim with fat lying on the couch. I can't bring myself to work and work on myself. One night, choking in tears, the thought came to open the veins. Because everything is tired to such an extent that I have been crying every day for a month now, and no one does not understand me. The young man who knows everything about me has changed in a terrible direction. Quarrels, screams, fights began. He's the only one to whom I can share something, and now he turns his back on me .. I'm tired of living in this world, accepting that I won't achieve anything here. It's easier to go to another world where I will be calm ..",
1,", I am a 24 year old guy. From the age of 13 he suffered from urethritis, then prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The reason was not found out, the tests are always clean, all non-invasive studies are in favor of a healthy prostate. But the bottom line is that I am incredibly suffering from this disease, from constant chronic pain in the perineum, and difficulties with urination, ejaculation, I am going crazy. Over the past couple of years, suffering has brought himself to neurosis, anxiety and depression. Constantly suicidal thoughts. As such, there is no solution to this problem, doctors wave their hands after the next course of antibiotics. He was treated by psychiatrists, drank a bunch of various antidepressants and benzodiazepines, but did not help much. Recently, having overworked myself, I found a job, and I really like it, and I like it precisely because I am distracted from pain, that is, when I work, I do not really notice the suffering. The problem is that in addition to CP / CPPS, I have a weak body in general, and I get sick once a month quite badly (chronic pharyngitis, tonsillitis). As a result, now I will have to quit, as often sick leave. It turns out that I was left alone and without an exit. Probably in my case only suicide remains.",

There is no person who would support me in difficult times. I wanted to commit suicide many times, but nothing came of it, I was scared and I realized that this was not an option.

My drunk friend was a witness and a participant as well. Almost everything bad that has happened to me in my life is because of my drunkenness. I understand all this, that I absolutely cannot drink, but I can’t help myself, like Russian roulette, I don’t know when it’s going to shoot, so I live, I don’t get drunk, but I can go to the trash.

And the town is small where I live, so I can't go to get treatment, but my son told me so sadly stroking at me, mom can you code ??? I was terribly ashamed. Yesterday I told him that I wouldn’t drink anymore, but I’m not sure of myself, I’m afraid that something shameful will happen to me, although it seems nowhere further and then there will be no turning back, I have yesterday the thought flashed that my life was somewhere on the verge of collapse ... but I was alone with my son, my mother and father had already died long ago, I gave birth to him not in wedlock, he is still 10 years old, I have to put him on his feet.

1,"! My problem is nothing compared to the problems people write about here. But I'm tired. Tired of living. For about 7 months now I have noticed that something is wrong with me. And every day it gets stronger. I cannot feel emotion. A lot of unpleasant things happened to me, I tried to calm down, come to my senses, and it seemed that everything worked out for me, but then I began to realize that something was wrong. I am not upset now, but I also cannot experience a drop of joy. What I was enthralled with before has now become something commonplace. I make music professionally, I play the piano. I loved it very much, it always helped me, but now this does not cause any emotions in me either. If I can play, then only from the head. It began to be difficult for me, although earlier this business went without any particular problems. I don’t have enough inner strength to just play a thing I’ve already learned, but I don’t have the strength to sit and practice as before. It became elementarily difficult for me to do everything, climb the stairs, get up in the morning, do simple everyday things. I always had order in the room, but now there is dirt and a mess. I don't communicate well with my parents. I have a huge concert program for the next academic year, but I don’t have the elementary physical strength to study. Also, I realized that I don't have people to whom I could tell all this, before it didn't bother me much, I'm not very sociable, and music brought me a lot of joy, and even if communication didn't work out, I always went into music, it saved me, now I feel completely cut off from everything. Previously, I calmly coped with all the difficulties occurring in my life, the peculiarities of my profession (huge physical and mental work, forced loneliness), and now everything falls out of hand. I want to wake up and lie down until the end of my days, but for now I force myself to get up and go do my job, but this is not for long.

I could tell my friends or my parents about it, but my friends left as soon as the problems started, and my parents left me to be raised by my grandmother when I was 9. Grandmother, by the way, hates me. She constantly yells at me and blames me for all her problems. As soon as I do something wrong, scandals begin. I am forbidden to go out and meet new people. Due to the fact that I grew up without parents, there was a lot of bullying at school and even beat me a couple of times. I hate myself for my weakness and my inability to take everything in hand. I tried to settle accounts with my life twice, but it didn't work. I just don't know what to do with it. I understand that if nothing changes, I will not give up trying to kill myself.

1,". I am 16 years old, and from the age of 13 I want to end my life. since childhood, my parents swore a lot. we lived in a small house, very far from the city. dad didn’t make a lot of money, and was constantly walking. Mom could not work as there was no one to leave me with. I don't remember much, but I remember one terrible moment when my father threatened my mother with a pistol and strangled her. I was 3 years old, I sat silently crying out of fear. When I turned 5, my mother divorced my father, and we moved to the city to live with my grandmother. my mother got a job, and sent me to one of the best schools in the city. a man looked after my mother, so at that time everything was fine with money. when I moved to grade 5, we had our own apartment, large but completely empty. we had to move there and sleep on a floor where there was no floor, gray walls everywhere, in winter we were freezing because there was no heating, and even doors. in the summer there was no one to communicate with, because it was a shame to communicate with the neighbors, because they could find out in which apartment I live. the grandmother had to sell the apartment inexpensively, and the money was divided in half between the two sisters. so nothing really has changed in our apartment. I had to change school, because I stopped studying well, and at the new school I had no friends, every day on the way to school I cried. We lived in such an apartment for 3 years. over time, my mother was able to save money and make repairs in the house. and friends began to appear. everything was fine. in the 9th grade, I had a big fight with a friend at school, they reprimanded me, and my parents transferred me to another school (I studied there for only 1 year) so that it would not be difficult for me. in the new school I was smacked, no one spoke, as if I was an outcast. I lost friends from the old school too. I had to endure all this. Mom was always sad because she really wanted to get married. she gave birth to me at 19, so she was very young. once she met by chance with an Italian, they talked on Skype for a long time, so they decided to meet. for 2 days they left for Turkey, then after another 3 months, my mother went to Italy to his family, she left me with my grandmother to decide everything there, and then pick me up. since her lover did not have an apartment, she had to stay there for half a year to help him at least rent an apartment, when nothing happened, my mother could not resist and returned to me. for half a year until she was away, I was constantly ill, and felt abandoned, although I knew how much my mother loved me. when she arrived everything fell into place, I had friends.",

1,"! My name is Andrey and I am now on the verge of suicide. I did not know that this is possible when you are completely eaten from the inside because of the problems that I got myself into because of my stupidity and every day you think about how to leave this life. Everything in order from its history, as it came to this. A year and a half ago, serious financial difficulties began to appear, I opened my own business, but it did not bring profit, and debts and debts to partners began to appear. In August-October of that year, I myself do not know how (as if the demon had infiltrated), I registered at an online casino, thought to recapture my debts and, as often happens, after a couple of winnings, I lost a very large amount of other people's money. I could not understand how I, not a gambling addict and an adult, could get into this. Throughout November I did not know what to do, I was not walking myself, but at that moment I was lucky and it turned out, not without kind people, to close this issue for a while. In January of this year, there was an opportunity to earn extra money, gave it to people, but in February at the end I went there again and I don’t even remember and don’t understand how I lost four times more than before. After that I didn't play, I started spinning as much as possible. It was until the time when the financial bubble inflated and burst, there was no way to twist and just work out in May. Now, since May, I have lost heart, every day I have thoughts of suicide <ed. Mod.>, I pulled on as long as possible to be with my child, wife and relatives. I didn't tell my wife, because knowing Her, she won't forgive me, and I can't live without them anyway. And I'll tell them how I can look further in their eyes what I have done. I was not a playman, I never took anything out of my house, but the devil himself at that moment possessed me and I have no forgiveness. I know that suicide is a sin, but I am already sinful, because I killed myself and my family on this weekend in the game, and even for some money. I tried to borrow, but I didn't manage to collect that amount, so suicide remains, and I wanted to see my son go to first grade, how I wanted to see him growing up, but I no longer have the strength to endure the splinter of my sin, my strength really left me ...",

He found out, I told about everything. As expected, he said that he forgave me, but there could be nothing more for us, shouting that I would die then, because my guilt cannot be bathed in anything, I left. I lay for a long time on the grass in the park, it was night, in principle, no one even saw me, I cried of course, you know, I never had such love. Although it lasted all half a year .. I begged to forgive me, to give me a second chance, I would have done anything to have him with me again, but he made it clear that he didn’t want to know me either. And I can't live without him, and the feeling of guilt just eats me up, I know you say to die because of love is complete nonsense, you are young and you will still have everything.

I hate my appearance, I hate it very much, my hatred goes to extremes (I probably have body dysmorphic disorder). I am ashamed of myself, it seems to me that people are disgusted to look at me. I don’t want to accept myself for who I am, I want a different appearance for myself, I don’t want to live in this body and therefore I will never love it. From this comes social phobia, I can't even go to the store normally. I have no friends, I have no one to even walk with. I cannot get new ones for the same reasons that I described above. I can't consult a psychologist either, because it's hard for me to talk with strangers, especially about such things. I live in a small town in Belarus and I hate this city. I would like to live in Moscow, in St. Petersburg or at least in Minsk, because in our city there is nowhere to even walk. I really envy the people who were born there. I am already sick of these five-story buildings and one single center for the whole city. I will not be able to move to Russia or Minsk, because my mother has no money for such a luxury, and I myself will never earn. I don't want to rot in this stinking city, I'm wasting my life.

And this time it's not teenage thoughts like ""my beloved threw me 15 and blah blah blah."" This time everything is much more serious. I will try briefly. Everyone expects something great from me, but I am not able to meet their desires. I feel that I am working in the wrong place. And I can't change jobs for many reasons. That and I have not yet found myself in this life and I doubt very much that I will. But this is not the root of evil. The whole problem is that nothing is already trite happy. Even biological needs such as food and sleep. No appetite, constant fears, absent-mindedness, insomnia. I lie down and wake up with a terrible feeling of fear and I don't know what to live for at all. All dreams and desires just disappeared. I don't want to do anything. I can't find a place in society. A stranger everywhere. Already even with people it is impossible to communicate normally. I fell in love with loneliness, but it is in loneliness that I realize myself and the meaninglessness of this life. I understand that depression is very strong and I cannot overcome it in any way. I am constantly lost, afraid of something incomprehensible, sometimes I ""wake up"" and ask myself the question: where am I and what happened 20 minutes ago? Degradation + depression = wanting to die. It's simple. I can hardly even write this article. It is unlikely that someone will read it, but can someone help. I will not say everything in detail, I will just write that I would like an accident or illness to happen to me, then my only wish for this moment will be fulfilled. One's own death is not as terrible as the death of loved ones, and that's just the thought of them and how they can continue to be held back from suicide.",

1,"please help, I can't do this anymore. I've always been an insecure and fearful child. since childhood, dad was strict with me. no, he allowed me a lot, like playing on the computer when other parents wouldn't let me, or playing in the yard longer than usual. but he wanted to raise in me a ""right child"" who always acts right, who looks at everything adequately. I was always either stupid or crooked, and I did everything wrong. then he started yelling at me, he could bring me to crying overwhelmingly when I didn’t have enough air to breathe, or he could hit me lightly. and my mother always scared me with ""dad"", in a mystical way, who will punish me for all my sins (conditionally) and will scold me if I don't do this or that. Thus, I developed the fear of my own father, tears welling up in my eyes when I saw him, and when he started screaming again, I could not say a word, but only sobbed. Now I'm 14. a lot has influenced me: my dad, and the school, which I was afraid to tears, and the people with whom I eventually lost the ability to communicate normally, and now I have become what I have become. indecisive, unable to take responsibility for herself, afraid to go outside once again, completely not adapted to life, I was lost. now I do not know who I am at all, and my only desire is to disappear, to evaporate. I understand that every year new problems, life tasks, responsibilities are piled on me, and I cope with them worse and worse. I feel anxiety all the time, every second, even now, as I write this, my heart is pounding. every day I face learning problems: it is more difficult for me to memorize information, speech is slow, I get confused in words and thoughts. I sleep a lot, to a headache, and on weekdays I hardly get up. I do not want to fall asleep because I know that tomorrow I will have another useless day at school, in which I will be disappointed again and again when I am afraid to speak to my classmates or answer in the lesson, although I know the answer, because I am really worried about what others think of me, but I diligently hide it. every day it only gets worse. thoughts about death, yes, thoughts of suicide more and more often visit me, every day I wake up with the thought: ""maybe die today?""",

I had a girlfriend with whom we talked for 7 years, there were feelings for each other, but in one ""wonderful"" moment I introduced her to my best friend (former best friend already). They began to communicate, in a month I find out that they started dating (maybe someone will understand how much it hurts when your girlfriend starts dating your best friend). I was angry with them and began to run into both. From a girl, I received a bunch of apologies that I don't need nafig, but from a friend of emergency in VK and ignore in real life. It was incredibly painful at that moment. 2 years have passed, but I love her the same way as then, I see her every day with him and it becomes sad, painful. There was also 1 best friend, he found himself a girl with easy behavior and she told him not to communicate with me. Of course he listened to her and I was left without 2 best friends. Now I have been sitting at home for these 2 years, I have forgotten how to talk to people at all, I don’t even know what to talk about. Accustomed to being alone, completely resigned to loneliness. Even on social networks I have no one to communicate with, I just go to listen to sad music. I want to commit suicide, I don't know what else to do. With my appearance, I will never find myself a girlfriend. Nobody even wants to be friends with me. I do not understand why I am in this world.

It all started from my very birth, my dad is an alcoholic and now he doesn’t even remember me, he can call once, and be offended that I did not answer him. He blew my psyche, and now I suffer from OCD. Treatment does not help, positive thoughts where will they come from if there is nothing good in life? My dad was not only an alcoholic, recently, a couple of months ago, I turned 14, and my grandmother told me, when we had a fight with my mother, what my father was like - he once beat my mother to a pulp and cheated on her. I was very worried, it was a huge stress for me. My father is bad, that is, an egoist. when he comes to his mother, she tells her that she should not care about me and that he is visiting her so that he gets attention. He can come for a couple of days, mother herself will call for a couple of times to eat, and that's all. Even if she sees that I am crying. She knows that I am offended, it hurts, but she just does not understand and, at best, says that she is me too loves. Naturally, I had a crush. And what? Only resentment and disappointment. And now, as you know, some teenagers are rednecks, sorry, of course. And it turned out that this cattle 2/3 of my class, they laugh at me that I don't have a boyfriend, well, not that they laugh, but they think below. Moreover, even the really creepy guys have guys, good, kind, understanding. I have NOTHING, although I paint, that is, I take care of myself and look at 16.

And its complications are infertility. Of course, I will get tested in a couple of days but what if I really become sterile? I'm really scared ... I see no point in correcting my pair of threes in the future if I can't have children - I also drew well, now rarely because of depression ... I drew at 12 as a 25-year-old experienced artist, but they didn’t even send me to an art school, because I’ve got a war in the city and I’m far away All circumstances are against me.

He, whom I thought was good, told me such terrible things, and I just don't understand why. I hate myself so much for not being able to tear before, when the wound has not yet grown.

1,"Greetings to all kind people. A little about myself: I'm 22 years old, I graduated from the university with honors, I go in for sports, I have no bad habits. In general, at first glance, everything is quite safe. But for 2 years now I have been suffering from wild depression, my every day is like riding a roller coaster, at first you feel the rise and movement upward, and then at one moment you suddenly fall into the abyss of despondency, despair, and the desire to leave this world. I want to say that fate for my 22 years has already plunged me into mud more than once, I have experienced the death of people close to me, betrayal, rejection of me by some people on the basis of my beliefs, many friends turned away from me after I decided to control my life, namely I gave up alcohol, started playing sports and studying well. If we talk about the problem, then I burn myself from the inside, nothing brings me happiness, my interest in everything around me, including development and social success, began to disappear. Now I have the peak of this state, every day I think about how I can seriously leave this life, I skip the pictures of death in my head, I literally hate myself. All this is supplemented by the fact that I love a girl with whom I had a relationship, foolishly we parted, did not communicate for 1.5 years, but not so long ago we began to establish contact, and yet, I cannot admit to her that I still love her, in her head is spinning that it will only cause laughter and nothing else. But it was for her that I felt sincere feelings. I have a persistent disgust for myself, I do not see any prospects for myself, and I think only about the fact that I will either commit suicide or die in some ridiculous way. I cannot get out of this state, I turned to God, I am Orthodox, and I realize that my thoughts are a grave sin. But nothing helps me, neither prayers, nor confession. It feels like my destiny is to burn myself from the inside, as if a countdown timer is ticking inside me.

1,"! I am a mother of a special child with mild disabilities, a mental problem. My son went through the path of rehabilitation from hopeless to the level of character accentuation. At the age of four, he was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. We were taken to a regular school, not without difficulties. When he started school, I quit my office job, started my own business and started doing it well. This is a ""male"" profession, production. Started working in 2012. But the crisis broke out, the demand for my products fell. Now I am in a dead end, there are debts that I cannot handle. Hands down. I manage to occupy myself with my daily activities, but I am more and more in apathy. There is no one to turn to with your problems. Parents (they are healthy, live a full life) do not take part in our life, it just so happened. There is no one close to you who could ""pick up and carry"", at least for a while. The ex-husband kicks out the child and all the problems, there is no need to wait for help from him. In general, I have problems that I cannot cope with. I notice things that I couldn't imagine before. For example, a mess at home, unwashed dishes sit in the sink for several days. I don't want anything, no new clothes, or somewhere to walk or travel, but before our life was full of travel and trips to events, to the movies, to walks. It seems that there are ideas of what to do with yourself, even with an eye to income, but some go through procrastination. Every day I am sucked into the swamp of problems even more. The main problem is debts. I have ideas on how to get out of the crisis, but I can’t do anything because of apathy and the thought that I didn’t succeed. I want to kill myself to end this.",

These were the most dear and close people to me. All the troubles of the terminal stage fell on me. In the process, I fell ill with pneumonia, and all these months I coughed, was ill, although a friend of mine controlled and treated me. I had no time to lie down.

1,". I am writing here because I want to kill myself. I know that suicide does not solve problems, but right now it seems to me the only way to change my life for the better. Not for yourself. For others. Everyone will be only happy if I am gone. I'm like a mosquito in an aspen hive - superfluous. Every day - either at school or on the street - hell, prison, a game in which I lose over and over again. Will you say that I'm just a teenager and don't understand anything? Yes, teenager. Yes, I don’t understand. But I've learned so many things in my entire life that you can never understand. I grew up much earlier than expected. And all because of childhood. And now nothing has changed. Every day I am insulted and beaten half to death. I can not take this anymore. I'm tired of being worthless. I'm tired that people do not understand me, they believe that if I am different, then different with all body and soul. This is not true. Deep in my soul, I am just like them. But they don't understand this. Why, why do they constantly beat me every day, take my things away from me and do not give me a pass? Why every time I hear in my back: ""So that you die, you filthy creature!""? Why am I forced day after day to pretend that I am strong and that I do not care deeply about offenders and resentments, when this is not so?",

When I was lonely, he found me, met, I felt a connection from the first minutes, he said the same. Similar life stories, light conversations, common emotions, an identical attitude. He admitted that he has a girlfriend, that it is difficult with her, but he will not leave her, we can only be friends. I promised him never to move away, not to leave him silently, he too. We saw each other secretly, to support each other, we could just walk or sleep in the same bed, no intimacy, nothing but a special friendship for him and a secret love for me, which I decided that he would never know.",

Otherwise, everything is terrible: constant lack of money; quarrels with my husband, who reproaches that I do not work, although her daughter does not go to the garden; health problems, sore back, very bad teeth, excess weight. I am also studying at the university in absentia, now it is a session, but I have no one to leave my child with, I sit and grow tails. Constantly depressed, I feel sorry for my daughter, she is already used to seeing my tears. I tried to kill her myself before pregnancy, I couldn't, and now I can't leave my baby without a mother. Right now I’m sitting sobbing, she strokes me, consoles me. I don’t want to live like that, but I can’t change something either. Constant pressure from relatives about studying makes it even worse.

1,"There is no health, medicine is expensive, the salary is enough only to keep on floating. Bad character (social phobia, introvert). This 100% will not have to count on your own marriage / family for a long time. It is unclear how she worked for a year in a team, probably behaved like a moron because of the eternal silence and other failures at work. In short, oddly enough, but the thought that I always have a choice of suicide helps me to live, they say, I always have time to die if I want to, that's what saved me. Although, the worse the conditions for existence for me, the more I adapt to this and the farther it seems to be the bottom. I just can't decide on suicide. I have no prospects, besides, they will soon be fired (laid off), and the work, after all, nevertheless made me more stable. And now I will no longer find myself anywhere except work in the field of dishwasher and other things for a penny, then it will become even more difficult to survive and is it worth fighting at all. No health, no money, no stability. By the way, I live with my parents, my mother is also ill + has closed herself into religion, there is no sense from her, it seems that she is not there. There is no support that I need, how is it so condemnation of the quarrel, I invented all my illnesses, social phobia uncommunicative means crazy. And before everything was better, we lived in prosperity, there were no health problems. All of this has changed because of the fraudulent trials that have turned our lives to the bottom. Why has life changed so much, all the time I scroll in my head the memories of the former carefree life, when I studied was healthy, and now life has crippled us so much with finances and health problems, there is no strength and energy to rejoice at something, in fact, here it is my end at 23. It won't be the same as before. I do not want to die, I am afraid of the unknown and the inability to control what will happen to my mind and body after death, it scares me. But my life is also not honey, it’s probably even worse ahead if I’m fired, I don’t want to go back into this vacuum of instability with parents with illnesses and memories of the past. I am so sad, terribly offended that my life turned out this way, if it was possible to return time back ...

By the way, from the moment I met him, I began to think about death, the fear of losing him envelops and I don't want to live without him. In a quarrel with him, he constantly tells me to leave, or he leaves, our apartment is rented. Three times in a year I insisted that either I leave, or he, it made me so badly, apparently madly in love. As a result, he left, after returning from work, I did not find him at home, nor did his things. The ground slipped from under my feet, I forgot how to breathe. I work in shift, I returned late, or rather at night, he was not there, he did not even warn me that he would leave. A day later we made up and I moved to his apartment, which he rented. Three months passed, he began to simply push me and say that he did not want to live with me, so that I would leave, did everything possible so that I would hate him. I endured a month, a couple of times I wanted to die to get rid of this terrible feeling. I even went up to the 26th floor, stood for a long time and looked down, I felt scared and sorry for my relatives and friends. As a result, I moved away from him. Two months later, he showed up, cried, sobbed, said what a fool he was and realized everything, and he did all this so that I would be happy, happy without him. Since it seemed to him that I was unhappy with him. A stupid act or a stupid excuse, a strong man will make his woman happy, and not give her into the wrong hands. As a result, they resumed the relationship, lived for three months and the next quarrel ends with the fact that he again does not want to be with me, in his opinion, an inadequate woman, every time he says that I am inadequate, but nevertheless returned an inadequate one, it is not clear why. It's hard to realize and feel like a naughty kitten, who is being pissed off but what he shit in his slippers. After all, this is impossible, it seems to me my psyche gave way, today I wanted to lie under the train, but I am madly afraid of pain. I tried to talk to him, said that for about six months I had thoughts of suicide, he just laughed and said that I was too hungry, that everything in my life is good, of course, he knows better. I want to find support in strangers, because I am afraid to scare my loved ones, the closest one, in my opinion, spits and does not understand. Maybe they will understand me here ... there are not particularly friends in this city, for friends who are in my hometown I remain strong and cheerful. At work, there is no one to discuss this issue with, if I start talking, they will forcefully close me for treatment, after which I can be fired. I can motivate anyone, support, suggest, but not myself ... I don't have a spark that will light me up",

All my life, I consider it a complete nightmare, some kind of misunderstanding. The attitude towards all people has changed. I became more irritable, aggressive. I also began to lose my love for everything. I used to love animals, but now I am skeptical about them. It seems to me that my parents don't need me at all. When my mother and I were fighting, she said that I could die, that if I commit suicide, she will not worry for a long time, she will cry and that's all, she also added that how many parents lost their children (during a fire in the Zimnyaya Cherry "") And nothing, they live, she also cited my classmate as an example, who swallowed pills and was sent to a psychiatric hospital. My mother told me bluntly that she didn't care about me. Perhaps she doesn't remember this anymore, but I will never forget these words. On the same day, I was going to commit suicide, but when I was playing cards with my younger brother, I said that if I lose (then I lost), then I would die, if not, I would stay alive. But I won my brother 3 times, so I thought that I was probably needed for something. So is my dad.

1,"Здравствуйте. Я всегда была прилежной ученицей в школе. У меня не было троек,помимо математики и химии,последняя вообще никак не шла,никогда. Я ненавидела ее,не любила и не понимала. Родители прекрасно знали об этом,но все равно отдали меня учиться на фармацевта в Петербурге. Балл у меня средний -4.14,но с ним на бюджет я поступить не смогла. Еще перед поступлением я сказала матери,что,может,я лучше пойду в другое заведение,вдруг не смогу,ведь профильным предметом является химия,которую я не любила еще со школьного порога. Мама не захотела меня слушать,сказав,что профессия очень хорошая,денежная,а учеба тебе понравится,со временем ты поймешь химию,и все встанет на свои места. Ни одно заведение,в котором была мама,не понравилось ей так,как этот фармацевтический коллежд. И уж лучше бы я пошла в обычный медицинский,где все же больше биологии,а химия общая,чем в фарм,где их аж 4. Первый год был очень тяжелым для меня в этом коллежде. Я с уверенностью могу сказать,что я невзлюбила его с первого дня пребывания в нем,но эти мысли я старалась выбросить куда подальше,самым главным было отучиться,и выпуститься с дипломом. За первый курс (это чистая правда) я не пропустила ни единого занятия,ни единой практики и лекции,с первого курса осталось куча тетрадей,записи и искалеченные нервы. Впервые после школы я столкнулась с гнетом преподавателей,которые явно видели,что химию я не знаю,пытаюсь понять-а не выходит. Да,я так и не поняла ее. За первый курс было немного троек-лишь по двум химиям и математике. Помню,как я ехала домой и давилась слезами после каждой неудачи на практике,по сто раз пересдавала,когда везло,когда-нет. Только одна учительница постоянно говорила мне,что я не закончу,и лучше бы отчислилась,чем заниматься тем,что мне явно не подходит. Говорила,лучше поступи,мол,в своем городке (живу в Ленинградской области,час езды до Московского вокзала),мозги твои не сильны,и не потянут для нашего колледжа. Меня эти слова задевали,я все рассказывала маме,она говорила ""крепись,ты все равно должна закончить,не зря же я деньги плачу"".. Я шла в эти стены через силы и через ежедневные слезы. За все это время меня понимала одна лишь бабушка,она меня и воспитывала. Мама снабжает финансами,и на том спасибо,но должного внимания с братом моим младшим мы никогда от нее не получали,она сама по себе жесткий человек. О своих каких то неудачах в учебе я боялась даже заикнуться,она сразу делала на что либо запрет,например на мои одиночные прогулки по вечерам,и то иногда (ибо я не того склада чтобы шляться где то с кем то бесконечно),я не выпиваю,курить даже не пробовала. Но я всегда для нее была и есть неблагодарная,и кого ж выростила,мол,лучше бы не рожала. Во время экзаменов (а я,признаюсь,крутилась как могла),я завалила химию на первом курсе. Из двух завалила одну-органическую. Но не зачли мне обе,чисто из принципа. Все остальные экзамены я перекрыла на 4-ки,ну кроме математики, соответственно(ее на три).Наверное,такой сильной аппатии ко всему у меня никогда то этого провала не было. После экзамена я еще несколько дней не ела,и постоянно ругала себя на никчемность и бездарность. Потом мне написала преподавательница и сказала,что перекрыла двойку по органической химии тройкой (выше я и не мечтала),втихушку от той,что завалила меня,правда. И вроде как все обошлось и так и не всплыло.. Первый курс был позади...",

It so happened that I didn't have much friends after marriage (I went far from my home). Communicated only with his relatives. Godfather also from the side of her ex-husband. After the divorce, all communication with me ceased. Constant thoughts of suicide, I'm in the deepest depression (I tried to go out on my own - trainings, webinars, marathons, sports) ... nothing helped. I have no money for professional help.

Sometimes there is a very lack of communication and there are constant thoughts of suicide. I want to walk and enjoy life, but somehow I don't even have anyone. I live only for my parents, but thoughts of suicide just don't go away. My parents look after my profession, but I just have no desire to do anything. They try to give me a lot, but I am a very lazy and depressed person. I don't want anything at all from this life and I just don't see its meaning. I do not want to discourage my parents and I do not want them to be hurt because of me.

This does not motivate me to live, in other words, my soul does not lie for this. I would like to want to live the way all normal people live.

To begin with, now I’m probably in a critical condition, into which I’ve probably driven myself, it’s just that everything has piled up like that ... I live in a rural hinterland, there’s no work I don’t have my husband, she’s not in the village at all, two years ago the last complex was destroyed. With money, eternal problems have recently more or less still made ends meet, and now we can say they have lost their last earnings. The house needs repairs, it should not be done on that, everything just falls and falls, as if on purpose. My mother (pensioner) also lives with us, she certainly has everything for the house, but the pension is also scanty and credit. Of course we earn little by little than we can, but every day it is more and more difficult do it. Also, health fails. It's also a shame that the husband's parents live in the center of heaven and fatten. (Or rather, his father and stepmother, his mother died long ago) They smile in their eyes pretending that we are not indifferent to them, but they themselves are building and building something, buy and buy. Do you think I'm exaggerating? Why do people living together - a huge refrigerator + freezer + one more refrigerator, 4 TVs, 2 washing machines, etc. The filling in the house is being remodeled almost every year (either very high or very wide) The whole house has already been rebuilt, and all I hear is that now we will finish it and help you. But having done one thing, they start spending money on another. It's a shame very much.

Even the kids do not make me happy (kids, chickens, puppies) there was a time I was so happy with them, but now I don’t even fit almost, everything is in flowers. I've always been there, but now I don't want to squeeze flowers. I used to try - to put on makeup, get dressed, but now I don't even want to comb my hair. Sometimes I want to open my soul, I want to hold on, but he either starts yelling at me, or says that I wanted to poop., Stare at the TV, I know that all the questions I I'll decide. And I no longer have the strength to decide everything alone, and I can't leave kudo. In general, with constant tears and thoughts, I brought myself to the point that I not only don’t want to do anything, but I also can’t, apparently from a constant depressive state (and even and there was a back injury) my back hurts terribly, my legs fail and I constantly roar, and often think about death and even about suicide. On the other hand, I want to live like this, I don’t want to die like that, but I understand that I won’t last long in this state. I don’t know what to do. I’m tired. I feel bad. All my life I have been such an active, cheerful person, but here everything is, I have no strength, and it kills me. Can you advise me in my situation? I don't know. But I will hope.

I'll start in 2015. I got a job in a hospital in the mountains (a nurse by education) and in the same month I met a guy (my husband) and we started dating. Everything was wonderful.

I took the car on credit. The husband began to tax. The work never went well. While I was working, in principle, there were norms. Then I went on maternity leave. But on maternity leave I also worked doing manicure. By the way, I often quarreled with my husband. I cried a lot and was nervous. Then I gave birth and the trash started. There was no money at all, my husband brought a penny which was not enough for anything. He began to let go of his hands very often, had a fight with my mother, she flatly refused to accept us with my daughters. He began to communicate, to meet with all sorts of girls. We had nothing to eat. I took all possible loans and bought food for myself so as not to die of hunger and I am still breastfeeding. The sister was very helpful. We were ill 2 times with our daughters. At these moments I just wanted to suffocate with the child so as not to suffer and torment her. My loan is not paid at all. Collectors are always calling, threatening. In March of this year, my husband had an accident. The insurance company has not paid the money yet. We are barely surviving. We practically do not eat.

1,", my name is Irina, I am 22 years old, I have a problem with social communication, since at the age of 14 I began to drink and smoke, walk around doorways and do not decency. So I went from hand to hand to a lot of guys. And so until the age of 17, for the first time I started dating a guy who studied at a naval school, he himself was not a local and therefore went to his house. To Mother's refusal, I said, “if you don’t let me go, I will commit suicide”, but in the end we parted after 1.5 years. Alcohol and easy availability again. Then another relationship, also lived together and I terminated the relationship. Since she cheated on him. There was a relationship with the military and also not local, easily accessible and trusting. Now there is a relationship, but it will soon be 2 years old, but we are parting and now I feel uncomfortable because I love this person very much, because I told everything about myself and what kind of life I had. Then I got drunk in the company and perhaps cheated on him for which I am very sorry and therefore I want to commit suicide. But this is not one of the reasons, there are many reasons. I can't find my hobby, I can't study because I'm not very good at everything. From the age of 16 I live without a father and went to work, I went to study later, of course, but did not finish, as it was hard for me with the guys because I did not lead a good lifestyle. Finally she took the Papers. And she went to work. She worked as a waitress, a cashier, and a painter. There were no hobbies, only gulps and alcohol. Now this is not, since my man is holding me. He helped me to start learning again, But I say we are parting and this makes it hard for me. I don't really like life, I have never enjoyed life, my attempts at suicide are 4 times.",

When my peers graduated from universities, I did not achieve anything. I have no friends, not a single friend. I feel that I am alone in this world. But I don't want to. The world never accepted me, and I want to leave it.",

For 2 years he fought with himself, worked to become better, to make friends, a girlfriend. But at one point he gave up, because even when it worked out, everything went downhill and became worse. And during these 2 years the light rays were at a minimum, and then they were somehow insipid. I have lost interest in my hobbies, the ability to enjoy them. Nothing interests me anymore. I feel that I am just dragging along this road of life. Without purpose and meaning. I do not see anything bright in the future either. I have a very important life period in terms of career, and I am in a state of complete passivity and inability to do anything. I am a burden on my father, which makes me hate myself even more. In communicating with people, I have long understood that no one likes me. He has not left yet, because he always considered suicide stupid. But living is disgusting and the thought cuts in more and more. Recently, I have already begun to imagine how I would commit suicide, and which method is better. Why live when you are disgusted with yourself and those around you, and for your loved ones you are just a burden ...",

I have many acquaintances and two best friends, for them I am a very friendly and good girl, but I don’t tell about my problems, I don’t tell anyone about it, although I have friends, I feel lonely.

I was then blind, stupid and arrogant. These years in the new city I have failed to do anything ... I have lost all hope. Their business did not go well, and as a result, a lot of debt and credit obligations. Now is the peak of the crisis, and I cannot take any step. I was crushed by the weight of a sudden awakening - 8 years, like one day. Of all that I have gained during this time is the realization that I am a worthless person - a vile, cowardly, cowardly reptile. Now I am lying down, shrinking from fear and pain that eats away at my chest, and I cannot do anything with myself, in order to do at least something in order to fix what I have done.

Of course, this is influenced by the attitude towards me in my school.

1,"Здравствуйте!В общем о моей проблеме , как мне кажется, родом из детства.Нас с мамой рано бросил отец(ушел к другой и уехал за границу),мама очень сильно заболела эпилепсией(бывало по 20 приступов за день),мамина сестра тоже болела эпилепсией и жила с нами.Из детства я помню , что в квартире постоянно пахло лекарствами, а бабушка с дедушкой мотались с одной больницы в другую к маме и тете.Тётя однажды упала и ударилась головою об батарею ,при очередном припадке, и вскоре в больнице умерла. меня в семье в общем никто не воспитывал, так как не было времени , и я почему то знал, что во взрослую жизнь я войду как сиделка своим родителям и тогда я впервый раз замкнулся в себе. Закончил школу, хотел поступить в институт, но тут умирает дедушка, и жизнь ставит мне условия совершенно другие. Все вокруг мне твердят, что я стал главой семьи и обязан ухаживать за больными мамой и бабушкой, я своего долга не отрицал, но понятия не имел как все это устроить и не свихнуться окончательно, тогда я второй раз закрылся от мира. В институт я так и не поступил, пошел работать, так как я единственный остался .кто может деньги заработать, работал на 2ух работах, на хим заводе по сменам, и охранником в школе,когда приходил домой, готовил,убирал, раздавал всем таблетки и ставил уколы.О личной жизни говорить вообще нет смысла, все деньги что получал, тратил за квартиру,еду,таблетки,откладывать редко получалось, но срываться начал часто и все что накапливал,тратил на кино, выпивку и разную ерунду. Друзей у меня нет почти, а справляться со стрессом умел только таким образом.Однажды я уехал на работу, и тут звонит мне бабушка и рассказывает , что меня ищет полиция....Я в недоумении, отпросился с работы, приехал домой, у бабушки инсульт, поехали в больницу. С полицией разобрались, там что то участковый перепутал, позвонил не туда, а бабушка к сердцу все близко приняла и вот инсульт..В общем инсульт дал ужасные последствия, ей парализовало половину тела и обнаружили сахарный диабет ко всему, через год отрезали ногу до бедра...В общем, мне сейчас 32 года, мама умерла 2 года назад, бабушка живет со мной, ее состояние критическое, памперсы, моча,калл,с головой у нее тоже помутнение, кричит на меня, обвиняет во всех грехах, пытался нанять сиделку, но мало кто может с ней долго сидеть, так как она слишком буйная, психиатра вызывал на дом, он заключил, что она вменяемая... В общем, что я успел за свою жизнь сделать,закончить школу и всё...нет высшего образования,нет прав,в данный момент тоже работу не могу найти, чтобы успевать за бабушкой следить, в итоге оказался в долгах, родственники есть, и живут с нами в одном городе, но они с нами только по телефону общаются. Я пытался с ними поговорить о проблеме, но у них свои проблемы, свои заботы, корректно дали понять, что это мой крест и мне его тащить.Я замкнулся в себе окончательно,жить я не хочу довольно давно, но страх перед грехом больше, чем страх перед этой никчемной жизнью.Я думал о будущем, умрет бабушка и что? Мне надо будет все наверстывать за все года,будет ли желание и силы.Честно говоря,меня одолевает жуткий страх, последнее время даже из дома не выхожу,зашториваю окна и сижу с бабушкой и тихо схожу с ума.Я понимаю , что я взрослый и должен взять себя в руки, но мозг отказывается соображать вообще,а пол года назад, у меня парализовало руку, ходил в поликлинику , невролог сказал . что все в порядке-это у меня защемление локтевого нерва, проколите витаминки группы Б и походите на физиопроцедуры. Ходил-не помогло, пошел ещё раз, сказали что нужна операция, но у меня уже нет ни сил ни денег,ни желания ко всему этому.Бабушка нуждается в круглосуточном наблюдении, иногда приходят соц.работники, иногда помогают мне соседки(тоже пожилые), в общем и целом такая история.

1,"For several years now I have been thinking about suicide. I got confused in myself and my feelings, I have no one to speak out and ask for advice on what to do. The feeling that everyone is indifferent to me and my life is completely useless. Very often I lock myself in a room and cry for a long time. At home, only reproaches: lazy, dumb, scary. Mother often snaps at harmless questions, and also likes to drink, which upsets me greatly (once they wanted to send me to an orphanage, my mother was on the commission); grandfather - all the time makes comments, sets strangers as an example. By the way, he is disabled (his legs are paralyzed), I constantly take care of him, I always feed and sing, change diapers and so on, but I have never even heard a simple ""thank you"". Mother and father are divorced, he does not want to hear about her or me, we do not maintain contacts. There are no friends either: I am very ""crammed"", we do not get along with other teenagers.",

1,". A year ago, she was a cheerful girl who graduated from school with honors and is looking forward to adulthood with joy. Now I can't find the strength to even get up in the morning. Since childhood I had * excellent student syndrome *. She achieved a lot in her studies, was not a difficult teenager. There were many friends, before the graduation class I met, perhaps, the main love of my life. But I failed the exams, did not go to the desired university, I entered where there were enough points, for the wrong specialty, and then they will soon be expelled, because I cannot bring myself to go there. The young man went to study in another city, became a military man, but I endured his brains, it was a shame that I did not stay with me, and she herself invited him to leave. He's a really good man. And he, too, expected support from me, which I did not give him. I have not seen so much care, love and understanding in anyone. We talked for half a year after the breakup, I very much loaded him with my problems, now he got along with my former close friend, with whom I shared a lot. And only after losing him, I realized how much I love him. I think about this person for days, what is with him and how is he. I often wake up in a cold sweat and understand that he no longer loves me, and that he is with her. Frequent quarrels with mom. I do nothing around the house, a burden on her neck. I got a job to earn extra money and distract myself, but all the same at night it constantly covers me. Sometimes, with attacks of hysterics, tremors begin, I consulted a psychiatrist, diagnosed with neurotic disorder, and prescribed pills. If the doctor did not help, he said to come for a second appointment, but I never went back. I understand that I deserve it all. The people around me did not deserve such a disgusting daughter, girl and friend. I only give people problems. The feeling that I can not love anyone else, I still love my ex-boyfriend. And I understand that I destroyed everything with my own hands. I can't calmly walk the streets, everything reminds me of him and the happy time. Very frequent mood swings, even now I cry for some reason. Enough time has passed, but I just can't get myself together. I know that I have to fight, to enter the desired university, to communicate with people, but I have been feeling weak for about half a year, apart from work I can’t force myself to leave the house. More and more often, and even now, there is a desire to simply commit suicide <ed. Mod.>. It only stops that my mother raised me alone and did not deserve this from me. I really want to feel the happiness of this life again, but every day I find myself more and more at a dead end, I hate myself for the ruined relationship with my beloved and I don’t understand when my whole life collapsed. Now again, not in very good condition, so sorry for such a chaotic story. Thanks a lot for your attention.",
1,"Good day. Today is June 3, 2018. I have never thought about death until this moment. It all started with the fact that in March 2017 I passed a semen analysis and a bunch of different tests and my results confirmed that I was infertile. Naturally beloved girl with whom we wanted a child and I have no strong family. The person supported me for about a year for a long time and believed that everything would work out and in the end everything was the same. I don't scold her. She left me, everything is in the order of things, she needs a family and a child. This is for the female sex at the genetic level. After such a verdict, I became heavily loaded with thoughts that there was no sense in procreation, that I could not raise my son or daughter, teach, protect, love. For this reason, over the course of time, he stopped communicating with friends and relatives. I live separately, that is, alone. Thoughts are always negative, left work. By and large, I just exist. I'm afraid of people, but before that I was always positive, I loved traveling and rafting on the river, everything like that. I cannot return myself to what I was before, but only because of the reason I said at the beginning. Naturally, I can't kill myself, but looking at myself like that will be hit by a car, and okay, or drowning in the river is not a big loss. I have not spoken to anyone about my problem since that year. Only my ex-girlfriend and me know. At the moment, she left to live in another city, we do not support communication. There is no even moral help.",

Although she did not study perfectly well, she was always an example for others. And for this I was often bullied in class. And now I have become the worst student. I want to change everything, but I'm afraid. I'm afraid to approach teachers and take assignments. It seems to me that this way I will look ridiculous and pathetic. They will think that I am stupid and will simply refuse. I do not know how to fix this, and time is running out. The session is coming soon.

It was unrequited love that created a hole in me. It filled with a void that I desperately tried to fill in every possible way. Like a hunted animal, I rushed to meet new acquaintances and frantically, eagerly looked for a replacement. She fell in love, broke her relationships and rushed into new ones.

He did not leave after receiving his own, even for a while everything was fine, but then it began to collapse. I began to fall in love more and more, and he farther and farther away. Almost nothing remained of his former attitude. I try to talk to him, but he just drifts off the topic, although he continues to write to me every day. I understand that I climbed into a swamp.

Recently I noticed that I choose people in my environment not for their personal qualities (kind, reliable, etc.), therefore I am not attached to them absolutely. My ""friends"" interest me only as a source of new information and a way to distract myself from my thoughts in an interesting company. I do not value any of them, nor do I value my family (parents, brother). I just don't feel anything for them. Many people like me, I have an interesting appearance, I do not lack attention, but this does not make it easier. I'm just very lonely and empty, and it seems that one can endlessly fall into the abyss of this state. I see no reason to live, the only reason to stay is that the mother has no money for the funeral, and those around her will discuss her. She is a good woman, I would not want her to worry. I'm also afraid to survive. Every day these arguments lose their power, and I cannot think of new ones. Help me please.",

I cannot produce anything useful, or enjoy something. All I can do is translate air and resources, hang on the neck of my aunt, who takes care of me only because she can live in my apartment that way, which I inherited from my dead parents. I don't want to die, because I am a living being, which means that I have an innate desire to live. But why should I live if I am worse than others?

I am unemployed (and there is no profession, I didn’t finish my studies, and I didn’t like the profession, in general I turned the wrong way) Not so long ago I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. I’m almost like an ordinary person. Before, I had plans for life, I had ambitions. I'm depressed now. Almost every day, I use tremendous strength to get out of bed. I'm mad at myself. Became terribly lazy and even more irritable than before. I have not tried anything in my life. The girl was not there. I am very withdrawn. Perhaps this is all from childhood. My father is a tyrant. I became even more afraid of people's looks and harsh sounds or movements. And most importantly, I hate myself. I can't get myself together to do something, like find a job. I only think that in the near future I will become an invalid. I do not have a hobby. I suppress suicidal thoughts with virtual games. After all, my family is not rich, and if I become disabled, I will be a burden for everyone. There is no strength to influence anything, strong depression, for more than one year. Please help me with advice on how to get out of this swamp. I'm drowning in it more and more",
1,"I have already written requests for help on this site, and now things are bad again ... I have been undergoing psychiatric treatment for several years. In general, I do not tolerate antipsychotics, but without them in any way, acute psychosis develops rapidly - the experience of unauthorized termination of medication has already been. I take a drug that is prescribed only for intolerance to other neuroleptics, as it has a high risk of life-threatening complications. I have been drinking this medicine for a long time, the risk of these complications is now small, but I have another side effect from it - spasms of the facial muscles. That feeling that tightens the face, or even the neck, the back of the head, moreover, there are days when these sensations last for hours on end. That twitching, spasms in the cheeks, forehead, neck, other parts of the body. Sometimes it happens that I feel that my cheek is twisting for a few seconds. Doctors say that this symptomatology is not corrected, that is, it is incurable without replacing the neuroleptic. But it is unlikely that it will be possible to replace it ... Doctors say that you need to get used to these sensations. But it's impossible to get used to it, it's hell. Not only are these sensations extremely unpleasant in themselves, I know that deadly diseases begin with spasms of the facial muscles - tetanus, encephalitis, meningitis. I am not vaccinated against tetanus because I am allergic, and scratches do happen. So as the face begins to tighten, it becomes scary - from severe anxiety to animal fear, and this is every day several times a day. Because of this, it’s scary even for half an hour to be alone at home or without my mother (I live alone with her in the suburbs, she’s already for many years) to go to the city for groceries - it’s scary that when I’m alone it will tighten my face. Regularly it comes to thoughts that it is better to die than to endure it. That it is better to have cancer and die quickly than to suffer so much for years ...",

I started my studies, although there is one more year left to unlearn. I stopped going to work, there are already so many passes for no reason, I think when I show up, they will be fired without any questions. From the university, too, most likely will be deducted if I do not pay a certain amount. For quite a long time, thoughts of suicide have not left my head. I understand that if I dare and do this, I will hurt my family and friends. But the feeling that I no longer belong to this world does not leave me. I do not feel any support, I am afraid that they will not understand me. Every day I deceive myself and others more and more. And as if I will not get out of this abyss of lies. In addition to this, there are also problems with my personal life ... I cannot overcome shyness in myself .. all girls see me more as a friend than a guy. The last year of these 19 years of my life seems completely empty. Almost every night I silently cry to somehow release the accumulated, but every night this feeling of complete loneliness comes again. Help me, give me advice, guidance ...

She wants to commit suicide and says that if I decide to do this, I must call her so that we can do it together. I rarely see her. And the last one is my twin sister. We are close with her, but I don't talk to her about my problems (I keep everything to myself), because she does not care. She has her own life and in her, unlike mine, everything is fine.

In addition, I have a very low self-esteem. I really don't have friends, I was an outcast at school, they don't bother me at the university, but even there I can't find a common language. I'm a very stupid, absent-minded, unable to do anything fool. I’m already very hard on my mind, even in small things. With my mind, it is contraindicated for me to drive a car, because very nervous and distracted, I don't remember that, and in addition, my unreal stupidity. Many at my age have cars, driver's licenses, from 18 they drive all over both boys and girls, but I will never get a license, because I'm a full hose, give me at least 100 attempts at the driving school exam, I will fail all of them. It is very difficult to memorize, information in the head does not want to climb at all. I've never worked anywhere, and I don't know where to start, for the reason that I can't do anything. Personal life is trash, with my appearance, character, mental abilities, hardly anyone will look at me. With studies, it’s also not ice, that I can close it myself, and for some items I pay cash.

1,Hey.,
1,"From the very birth I lived with my grandmother, because apparently my mother had not yet walked (she gave birth to me at 16) When I was 9 years old, my only best friend committed suicide, she was a year older than me. A month later, my grandmother died. But let's from the very beginning, at the age of 6 I started learning to ride a bike myself, I knocked my knees, elbows, but I learned to ride it. Mom came once a month and taught me how to ride roller skates. At the age of 7, she took me to school and after that I did not see her for a long time. Every day I watched how other children were taken home by mom or dad, and me by Grandma. They mocked me at school, but in my house I found a friend, we often played with her, went to each other, but in the yard we were often beaten by boys from the yard. I always promised myself when I grow up I will fill them. When I turned 9, Rina (my best friend) and I vowed to each other to die on the same day. A month later, she committed suicide and I tried too, but I was scared. Even later, my grandmother died. And three years later I saw my mother who came to pick me up. It turned out that my dad and sister appeared. But I hated her from the very arrival, because she was constantly given a lot of attention, but I was not. I moved to another school, but I was also humiliated and beaten there, but I got used to it. My parents didn't give a damn about me, they beat me with a cable, and with their hands, and with a belt (everything that came to hand). All that saved me was the blade with which I cut my hands. I splashed all the pain in the cuts. I hope many will understand me. I closed myself in. In the sixth grade there was the first suicide attempt, the second and the third. In the seventh, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh. In the eighth, the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh. Despite these pathetic attempts to kill myself, I still want to die very much. But I live for my girlfriend (yes I'm a lesbian). And I hate it in myself, but I can't help it. At school, when everyone found out about it, everything started even worse. I often skipped school but realized that there was no point. Now I am in the eighth grade and I am studying for another three years. And it kills me very much. What should I do?! Yes, I'm not beautiful, fat (they tell me that 50 kg is a lot, I agree with them), maybe I'm not very smart, but I'm talented (many teachers think so). I paint, write poetry, books, songs, sing, dance. But I don't give a damn about it like everyone else. I don't care about myself, who needs me so poor. My stepfather started to drink, my mother breaks down on me. No friends. There is nothing but my girlfriend. And then it seems to me that she will leave me. In the spring of 2017, my autumn good friend raped me. But I did not tell anyone, I am still afraid of him. Nobody knows about it, but it is killing me like that. What should I do?! Tell me please. I can't do this anymore !!!",

1,". My name is Dasha and I am 15 years old. About 3 years ago, for the first time, I had a feeling of complete loneliness. Previously, this feeling came and went, but gradually it appeared more and more often and now it is with me constantly. It seems to me that it is very slowly killing me inside and I do not know what to do. I thought a lot about what (who) caused this feeling and why it is only getting stronger every day. I came to the conclusion that every year I am closing in myself more and more and every year it is harder for me to find friends (I have enough real, acquaintances). Whenever I get closer to someone and try to open up to someone, I get the feeling that a person hears me, but listens. In short, when I start to “make friends” with someone, I have the feeling that I understand this “friend”, but he does not have me.",
1,". This is the first time I am writing about my problem on the site. It's just that it’s very hard right now, you need to talk it out. A couple of days ago, I divorced my husband, whom I still love. The divorce was on his initiative, he fell out of love. I lived in his apartment and in a strange city. After the divorce, she decided to move to another city where there are at least relatives. I don't have my own home, all the time with my mother in rented apartments. Now I am trying to get a job, but, unfortunately, they still do not take me anywhere. I can’t live with my relatives for a long time, and now I don’t have money for rented housing. Every day I think about my husband, I miss him and our dog, which I had to leave with him. I am very attached to her, without her I feel bad. I'm all alone now. There is not a single friend with whom I could talk about this. Each new day starts hard, the feeling of loneliness and fear does not leave me. I am very scared to live on, this uncertainty and instability kill all good thoughts that occasionally arise. And I do not believe that after a divorce I will still have a loved one, family and children. I'm tired of all this.",

I am terribly ugly, I hardly look in the mirror, I am constantly envious, I hate beautiful people.

I can hardly do anything. I also study very badly: now I am finishing 11th grade, at the exit there are only three grades in the certificate, I'm not really ready for the exam either, I’ll pass badly, and I don’t care how I pass it, to be honest. At home, my parents are constantly yelling at me, constantly trying to make me feel guilty, they insulted me all my life (bastard, pig, idiot) and yelled, even for sitting in the kitchen when my stepfather was impatient to devour. And instead of normally asking me to leave, insults fell upon me. And people have bullied me all my life. What's in kindergarten, what's at school. And now I am constantly worried about my future, I have no idea what to do, because of the fear that I won't succeed, I just don't do anything. And I constantly blame myself. I constantly criticize myself, I feel guilty, do not understand why, because of fear I can not do anything. There is literally nothing good in my life. Absolutely.

1,"Good evening. My name is Xenia. I'm stumped. For the last month, thoughts of suicide have visited me more and more often. I have been married for 4 years and have a son, he is about to turn 4. 5.5 years ago I met my current husband and literally six months later I moved to his city, leaving everything in my own. They confessed their love to each other literally in the very first month of the relationship, even before moving. We love each other very much. We love our son very much. But we are not happy. The fact is that a year and a half ago, my husband cheated on me with a former mistress even before me with whom he was. Six months later, it happened again. Anyway, all 5 years my husband is lying to me. It all started with the fact that he deceived me about smoking all kinds of drugs. Each time I forgave him for that. I forgave him for the first betrayal. Only thanks to his mother, she told me a story about the fact that her husband, too, once cheated on her. They have been living together for 27 years. If not for her story, I probably would not have forgiven him because I was not ready for it. But, I love him so much that I step over myself, I miss all the shit he brings home. Over the past two months, he has changed a lot, he has changed, he started to fix everything, he began to try, became more affectionate, more attention, more hugs and kisses and everything like that. But I live with distrust all the time, I always think that it will happen again sometime, because I forgave him 1,000,000 times. He made the same mistakes many times. Repeating the same thing over and over again. But today he found out about my correspondence with the young man. There was nothing. Just correspondence, just communication, no hints. I understand that I myself betrayed him. I don't understand why I did it. But most likely I just didn't have enough support. I dont know. And now, against this background, everything is bad again. I'm not trying to justify myself, but I think that these are the consequences of his attitude towards me all this time. For the last couple of months I have been in a state of depression. I do not understand this state, because today it is, and tomorrow it is not. It happens that I wake up in the morning and the thought that he can change me again haunts me. The thought of what might lie again arises constantly. It may seem silly to many, to forgive constantly a person who wipes his feet on you, but I do not lose hope that someday we will become happy together. In spite of everything, we love each other I do not want another person, I only want him, I only want to be with him, in spite of everything. But I don't think I can take any more. The only thing that stops me from suicide is my son, my little, my beloved son, I cannot leave him alone. I cannot hurt him that much. In the end, I cannot leave him without my mother. As strange as it may sound against the background of the thought of suicide, he is my meaning of life. I'm afraid that someday I won't be able to stop myself ...",

1,"Моя жизнь разрушена. Я боролась ,как могла, но теперь совсем не вижу выхода. Я страдаю социофобией и паническими атаками, но не смотря на это я училась, закончила бакалавр поступила в магистратуру, но недавно бросила из-за случившегося со мной ужасного события. Меня опозорили и оклеветали. Это сделал человек, в которого я была влюблена. Еще учась в школе я влюбилась в человека, которого никогда не встречала, но была уверена, что непременно встречу. В школе страдая от неразделенной любви, я обратилась к Богу и сказала Ему, что не могу страдать и что в следующий раз, когда Он мне пошлет любовь, пусть она будет обращена к моему будущему мужу. Я увидела человека по телевизору, он мне очень понравился, я влюбилась в него и во мне стала жить уверенность, что я его непременно встречу. И я его встретила, но ужасно стеснялось его. Мы встречались с ним "" глазами"" на протяжении нескольких лет. Вернее он пытался со мной познакомиться,а я бегала от него на протяжении этих лет, ужасно стесняясь и прося Бога никому его не отдавать. Я очень мучилась на протяжении этого времени, пришел день, когда я сказа себе сейчас или никогда и решила во что бы ни стало познакомиться, а он, когда узнал, какая я, оклеветал меня и опозорил. Он красивый и успешный человек, достаточно известен и, наверно, познакомиться с девушками для него не проблема, а я оказалась проблемой, ведь я бегала от него , а не за ним, может поэтому он так хотел добиться своего, то есть познакомиться. Он следил за мной, я не знала до самого последнего момента, но он проник в мою квартиру, установил камеры и взломал компьютер. Однажды у нас с моей подругой состоялся откровенный разговор, мы переписывались, я рассказала ей о ситуации и о том, что боюсь. Меня и до этого обсуждали в универе, что я странная, трясусь отвечая и боюсь людей, он думал это сплетни, а тут я сама все подтвердила, тем же вечером я встретила его у себя во дворе с близкими друзьями, где он меня унизил и облил грязью при них, я убежала снова, ничего не ответив. А потом он унизил меня публично, показал по телевизору, оклеветав и опозорив. Мы с ним похожи,многие в университете и в городе считали меня его родственницей, поэтому сейчас меня многие узнают и при встрече не прочь кинуть пару оскорблений. Пробовала я уехать и вернуться в свой родной город, там меня тоже встретили не лестно, смеялись и кричали оскорбления. В университете надо мной тоже смеялись и обсуждали. Я сбежала с универа. Понимаю, что так только оправдала всю грязь, которой меня облили, но не вытерпела. После всего этого, я вообще практически перестала выходить на улицу, впала в депрессию. Я училась на языковом факультете, язык без практики забывается, поэтому мои знания ухудшились. Я пробовала восстановить, но вернуть прежний уровень не получается. С такими знаниями меня не возьмут на работу.  Кроме отсутствия знаний, под влиянием пережитых событий расцвела моя социофобия, я практически не выхожу из дома, чувствую себя изгоем. Спустя год, этот человек вновь появился в моей жизни, попросил прощения, сказал, что поможет мне измениться. Но я не смогла ему довериться, к тому же не смотря на извинения, он мне угрожал еще большими проблемами, если я подам на него в суд. Самое ужасное, что я во многом виню себя и продолжаю его любить, временами злюсь, пытаюсь убедить, что он подонок, но никак не могу забыть, несмотря на то что он сломал мою жизнь. Я не красавица, но вот понравилась же ему. Я знаю, что я никому не нужна и живу сейчас нахлебницей у папы на шее. Я бы уехала за границу, но здесь моя социофобия закрыла мне путь. Такая как я нигде не нужна. Я не могу выйти на улицу, не могу никуда уехать, но и жить нахлебницей я тоже не могу. Мне нет места на этой земле, есть только один выход, на тот свет.",

And so to the problems, I can't stand our break, every day I cry, I started smoking and sometimes drinking, just because there is no one to support. I do not trust my parents, because many times I tried to open up to them, and they either started accuse me of being to blame for everything, or just yelling. Yesterday I realized that I had no friends. All my last friends betrayed me, I do not know what to do with myself, I remember the moments with them when we laughed and just walked the streets and laughed, at these moments the same moments attacked me , but only about the ex-boyfriend.

1,"I got to the point that at the age of 27 no one knows at all, I have no friends, even in such a small wretched town where every dog ​​knows each other, I was left with nothing. The fault is my own social phobia, fear of everything and everything, it turned out that the same boy remained in the body of an adult guy as 10 years ago, when I stopped active life. All I do now is just go to work, come and just spend time with myself, shutting myself in. It would seem an adult, but no. I started looking for some kind of hobby to fill the void, but whatever I did, everything went away quickly, a typical example, when outwardly a person has absolutely no problems, works, lives, but he is not a member of society, he just plays a role for society as a means of payment taxes. You look at other people and think how easy everything is for them in life, they change girls like gloves, communicate with everyone, even with those girls that I ""walked"" everyone knows them, nobody knows me, like a ghost. As if he disappeared and drove himself into a prison in the form of 4 walls of his room. I try my best to seem normal to others, wearing a mask, but nothing works, it's only temporary, the real me then immediately appears, silent, quiet, squeezed in myself. Such people can no longer be remade, for too long this semblance of personality was laid in me over time, and after all, he refused everything, there were friends and communication, but then for some reason everything went away, I don't know what influenced me, why something kept me from everything this at a distance. I don’t know what will happen next, but I will not be able to join any company normally with my idiotic problems. Is it just a crisis? Sociophobia is a very serious disease, like cancer, it kills a person from the inside, drives him into a corner and chokes him with constant thoughts of his worthlessness. Looking around and seeing how others enjoy life, you compare yourself with them and feel lost and a stranger at this celebration of life, outwardly you cannot say anything, only modesty, but real hell is happening inside, but what a way out of all this, just suicide.",

But my genetics is such that I have always looked like my bad father. He was a gambling addict and I also showed it sometimes. But all 5 years at the University, I didn't get anywhere, I didn't play, everything was fine. But after the appearance of the girl, I wanted to constantly buy something, give her something, I was very glad that I could afford it. At some point, I started playing. It was sports betting. I won and played, everything was just as normal, bought her a phone, went on vacation. But then the horror began for me. I lost, I took the money for long - I lost that too. Then I wanted to win back - I took out a loan. He returned part of it, lost part. And no, just to return those 2000 UAH every month on the loan. So I took another microloan, then I borrowed money from friends and off we went .. Half a year passed, I lost my girlfriend, I lost support. I now owe $ 10,000 to everyone (friends, banks, MFIs). In fact, if it weren't for the MFI, I might still feel fine. I stopped gambling, I spend all my money now on paying off loans. And I have such huge interest that I hardly have enough money to pay off this interest. I can’t borrow money from my friends to refinance loans. Banks do not issue, because there are a lot of microloan debts. I will never take microloans in my life. Tomorrow I have the last days of paying half of the loans, but I have no money. I am constantly looking for money now, I'm just worn out all over. I can't do anything except think about where to get the money. Soon the collectors will go to me, then the court.

1," readers !! This is a cry from the heart! I don't even know where to start, it all started from childhood. Everyone rejected me, they persecuted me from everywhere, and in the literal sense of the word, I am not exaggerating here at all! They just scoffed, kicked out of the kindergarten because of this, they say the problem ... the school started, that's where the nightmare is !!! My classmates scoffed, beat me, didn't want to communicate, and if they did, they just attacked me, even for invented reasons, and I couldn't even understand why ??? At home - constant scandals of parents, their fights in front of my eyes, my mother took off all evil on me - beat me even for the smallest offense, for example, a four instead of a five ... I was bruised from head to toe and so all my childhood, friends, like it is already clear, I never had, no and probably will not ... well, okay, I thought that I would become an adult, everything would change, they say, whoever was not thrashed in childhood, it will pass, but no. I grew up in a school of grade up to 8, continuous fights not for life but death, humiliation, insults with the last words from both girls and boys. As a result, in the last fight I broke down - then I just endured humiliation and ridicule without doing anything - some kind of barrier appeared for me .. I graduated from school, entered a profession under pressure from parents, and the most disliked type of daughter of my mother's friend entered there and I need to go there write down so that she was under the thumb, they also disliked me there, even in tests like whoever you wanted to communicate with, they wrote my name, yes, I saw it myself, quietly peeped. So I studied with ridicule and contempt - you go and laugh in your back and I'm sure that above me, I can clearly hear my name! They wanted to survive in the dorm room, from the neighbors to the commandant's wife, for some reason, I don’t know, probably because while these neighbors were drinking somewhere, sorry for being rude, I didn’t have time to clean under their beds on the day of checks ... like, again, problematic ... and they came to the clean room again and brought trash, and sometimes I didn't even want to return for my own, there was such aggression, as if I had shot their families, no kidding ...! They didn’t call me to the graduation ceremony, but they didn’t tell me, but the headman phoned the others, and they just called me when it was over, saying “what didn’t you know?” - with a sneer. My specialty was not at all working as a seller here and there - I was fired from the first store, from the other I left with a serious illness, as it was harmful. No apartment (I lived in a rented one), no money, and there is no health either for women or in general. With close relationships, to put it mildly, unfriendly. In general, my mother always set me up as an example of the daughters of her friends, like she is normal, this is really a daughter, (but I saw this daughter - an ordinary girl - and smoked and cursed and walked, only the adults did not know this), and this (I) - damn what. That I ruined everyone's nerves, for my 26 years of life, such a bastard. Now other relatives, for some reason, sided with her. Once I came to my grandmother and was convinced - no one believes a single word of mine, and repeat after my mother - you are a moral monster. Like this..",

My father, too, with a tower, but design engineers were not needed. He worked as an electrician constantly rowdy drank with drunks. As a result, he left for his city and died there. I hung out with local gopniks and confidently I didn’t face the truth, putting on pink glasses of self-deception. I wanted to become a rapper or a businessman or a crime boss (in short, the mass media did their job.) At the end of the 8th grade, local boys stopped hanging out in our yard, one friend turned away from me. The next one too. In the 9th grade I was thrown out with triplets. in the summer I went to earn some money at a sawmill and the month of this hell cannot be described by the convicts alone, plus one of my colleagues had HIV, AIDS. I was not jokingly worried that he could infect me. therefore, having entered the technical school, I did not really study there, debugging everything back and back. then all the same I checked, but by that moment I had not gone to college. I started to spread rot local-fat cattle, some teachers. I myself was a gopar, but I understood where he saw it. Mother lives near my stepfather comes and leaves food and travel , asks me what happened to me, I don’t say. the money that is left for me to travel I spend on cigarettes. Generally I live on the outskirts of eburg in Khrushchev. Around the drunks, the outskirts of the EPT. I look at my scenario in life, so I work as a waiter expelled, and what? all my life? I wanted to study seo, but my knowledge of matan will probably not be enough for me. I wanted to become a copywriter, in Russian I write illiterately. Still crushes the crap, they say, I’m not studying since grade 6. I went to school in class and drove a bald. In general, I don’t know how to live. I’m still gnawing at the crap, saying that he worked at the sawmill? I did not study well at school? Then you’re a complete friend! Brother says that I have to solve problems. And how can I solve problems? Do not learn from the 6th grade! From the 6th grade!",

1,Ehh  people who will read this,
1,", I'm 20 years old and I feel like my life is over. It all started 2 years ago. Until the turning point, I was an ordinary cheerful person, studied at a medical university on a budget, I had a young man, I knew that I had a future. Towards the end of the first year, something happened that I did not even think about - my mother suddenly dies, practically in front of my eyes. From that moment on, my life went downhill. My father has a different family, together with my stepmother, they constantly spread rot on me, and the relatives - apparently, felt that they were left without protection, found another target (they also spread rot against my mother). Ultimately, I was left without an inheritance, support, completely alone. Irreversible processes began: I quit university and went to work. Alcohol, insomnia, anxiety every day. I felt like I was broken. A year has passed, the oppressive state has not passed, I more or less came to my senses. Through force she re-entered the university. But here I got worse. At the moment, I have 2 suicide attempts behind me. I feel like complete shit, I am constantly shaking, I practically do not sleep or eat, I do not go out, I am afraid of people, and I can not stand sounds. I can't pull myself together, there is a wall in front of me. There is no support, in my personal life there are only failures (I was considered only as a sexual object, and then thrown). I've never felt so helpless. I see only one way out - to kill myself. How to begin to control yourself, and what is the matter with me in general?",

I would like to be an expert in something, to do something useful or what I like. But it is too late and expensive to retrain, and I don’t know for whom. In childhood, they did not teach to think for themselves, the main thing was to listen to the strangers. It turned out that the elders also make mistakes and everything that they taught is deceit.

Now the realization has come that mother is not eternal and it will not work to sit on her neck all her life. I am in a panic about this. Frequent panic attacks. Quite by accident I got a job at an auto parts store. But ... I don't really understand anything about auto parts. I don't know how to drive, no rights. Accidentally got there ... Two women work with me, one over 40, the other under 60. It is also difficult to establish relations with them at work. It's easier for them to do something themselves than to explain anything to me. I go to work and just look for the fifth corner there for 8.5 hours a day. There is no sense from me. I don't think they will tolerate me there for long. But there is nowhere else to go ... There is practically no education, no work experience either ... My life has no meaning at all. Besides my mother, I have no one, and she is no longer young ... I don’t know what to do. Suicidal thoughts are frequent. 4 years ago I tried to go to a monastery, but only survived there for 4 months. I didn't find the meaning of life there too ... I don't know what to do.

1,"Good day to all! I had a very difficult childhood, I suppose everything comes from there. My dad was a tractor driver, and my mother was a disabled person, and all my childhood, my younger brother and I can be considered living on their own, no one looked after us, there was no money in the family, they went ragged and collected bottles. Then even worse, my mother died, I was 15 years old, and my father died after her in my 17 years. My aunt and uncle drank a lot in those days, and my brother and I were taken into care by a second cousin, only because of money, as she was paid extra for us. As a result, after school, I entered the university out of competition (as an orphan), graduated with grief in gender, then there was one job in my specialty, now another job is also in my specialty, and I still can’t figure out this work, nor how I can’t find communication with colleagues, I consider myself the most stupid, that I don’t know how to do anything, so I want to quit this job, but since I don’t know how to do anything, I don’t know where to go, and I live in a hostel from work, then I’ll quit and have to go outside. My brother is also unemployed. Friends, whom I do not have many, since I am not a sociable person, also no longer want to communicate with me. As a result, by the age of 30, there are no friends or relatives, there has never been a permanent girlfriend either. Apart from my brother, I have no one, and I do not know how to do anything, and no matter how I can not figure it out, so I suffer constantly. Already from time to time bad thoughts come into my head, why I live, what I live for, all alone, no one needed. There is no one to celebrate the New Year with, there is no one to celebrate a birthday again, etc. Already it seems to me that I have a constant depression, nothing pleases me, and a constant feeling of fear, and what will happen next, how to live like this or may no longer live at all.",

I would have moved from words to deeds long ago, but I have a son (5 years old), the responsibility for which lies with me. Vicious circle. There is no money for a psychiatrist. I think the problem is hormones. Maybe there are pills that can help you deal with such terrible mood swings. With my husband, of course, a separate hell ... did anyone turn to a doctor for help in such situations? Were there any consequences? How has taking the pills affected you?",

I am overweight. My ex-best friend always called me names. And others joined at the same time. Ask why I communicated with her? Because I was afraid that no one else would accept me. My communication with her ended. There was a new problem, my brother. He also humiliates me. Everywhere. And he does not care that I am his sister. Then everything worked out, I got used to everything. A year ago I made good friends. But I can't tell them what I'm worried about. My parents are mired in debt. We can't afford anything. I see how others enjoy their lives. I have to Tolerate this for two years. It will never end. Parents constantly quarrel over this. Dad recently left home. Mom constantly nags everyone. Doesn't let me choose what I like. Thoughts of suicide visited me before the new year, and now again. Everyone says that money is not happiness. But in money. You should see how we live. I do not see my future. Thanks to my parents, I constantly lie to everyone. I can’t even take a walk with my friends. It hurts. It hurts. Help me please",

But in the end this is only a visible effect. I have no goals, desires are superficial and quickly go away, all I do is exist. I live in dreams, I run away from the gray reality, but you cannot run away from yourself. And I still don’t fully understand the reasons why I feel this way - I have a family, a home, friends, I study ... But I realize this is an imitation of a normal life, it’s like it’s not my life. I cannot be frank. Just not with anyone. After all, all my friends think that I am cheerful, the soul of the company. The family thinks that I am calm and reserved. And inside there is only a desire to run away as far as possible, to start over, to be distracted, and sometimes worse. I think about suicide more and more often, but so far I hold on out of pity for my mother. She won't survive. But I'm scared that one day I won't be able to cope and my emotions will prevail.",

When she confessed her love, he said that he did not feel anything for me and there was no sympathy for me. Any normal girl would leave after such words. And after these words I have been with him for 7 months. He never paid attention to me, did not support me. Didn't say nice words. There is absolutely nothing from him. And I really need it. Occasionally he can say how beautiful I am today. Or mimics. In general, the only person in the world with whom I want to be when I feel bad or good, pushes me away.

I don't even remember the last time she kissed or hugged me. She reacts to me aggressively and from the outside I watch how she treats her younger brother, who is my stepbrother. She constantly hugs him, kisses him, hugs him. It hurts me so much to look at this, you would know, I am offended that no one hugs me and kisses me like that. I live with grandmother. And she constantly spreads rot, calls me names, humiliates me. She says that I am fat, that I am a mare, and although my figua is very very beautiful. They constantly yell at me for every little thing. I want to tell you roughly so that you understand because of what little things. My grandmother went to the store, buckwheat was cooked on the stove in a saucepan. She didn’t tell me anything, I was busy in my affairs and therefore didn’t know that something was being cooked there. As a result, the buckwheat burned and the pan too.

1,I've been an outcast all my life,
1,". Something terrible is happening to me. I am tormented by my past. The fact is that as a teenager, at 15-19, I walked a lot, drank and made a lot of mistakes. I am ashamed that then I did not understand what stigma I put on myself. I saw the world in a completely different way and did not think about the consequences of my actions. I had a lot of boyfriends, I trusted some and hoped for love and long-term relationships, but time after time I was used. And then I spat on the fact that no one really appreciates me and no longer hoping for love, just had sexual intercourse with someone, getting drunk to hell. There are such shameful stories from which my conscience gnaws from the inside. Later I found my destiny and got married, but I never told the whole truth to him, about how many guys there were, etc. We now have children, I am 27 years old. I scold myself so much for my past way of life, I'm afraid that someone will tell my children what kind of mother they had and my husband will recognize and hate me.

1," everybody! I'm afraid my story will be confusing. I am 33 years old, I am now in a strange state, I want to give up. I don't want to do anything else and I am terribly ashamed of myself, for these thoughts. All her life she lived looking for the easiest way, was arrogant and arrogant, without reason to be proud of herself, taught the life of others, and she herself lived (and I live) like a fool. Now I understand that I have no interests. The worst thing is that I don't want anything. My mother, my friends support me, and everyone says what to do. But I do not want. It's scary to go to the next world, but it's even more scary to live, because I have no desire to fight. I don’t understand if it’s a syndrome or if it’s me. A weak and insignificant person who has done so many fatal mistakes. I live in sin (drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, obscenities, laziness, pride, deceit, despondency). Now I'm trying to get into a mental hospital, again running away from problems. I live in a foreign country, I have a place to live, I have a job that I am now trying with all my strength to do, but I do it out of fear and persecuted by fear (I do it carelessly, consciously). I understand how much I have to do to fix everything that can be fixed, but I have no desire. I want to go to bed and sleep, I constantly yawn, I hardly eat. I fall asleep with sleeping pills, I don't want to get up, in a dream I can not think about it all. The tremor of the hands, the chest constricts everything, the thoughts are unclear, the feeling that the brain is a 5-year-old child, and fear, all-consuming. Anxiety the size of the world. You can't get to a psychiatrist, there is a queue. And I'm not sure I won't give a damn about everything tomorrow. I'm going to work now. I ask God in my mind to be with me. But he never left me, it was I who dropped my hands, and for a long time. So I really want to understand why I don't want to do anything. And how to get together, I want to sleep, only sleep. I know that you will advise me, I hear this every day from loved ones, but I do not want to do anything. I really want to know why. I have no purpose, for a long time, and interests, as I have already mentioned. It turns out I'm just a dull schmuck, utterly lazy, yes. I understand that neither the doctor nor anyone else will solve my problems, only herself, and I have no desire. Do I really want nothing. Until recently, I wanted a family, beloved husband and children so much. And today I understand that so much needs to be done for this that it is better to give up this thought. Drowning in self-pity, long ago All my life I blame someone for my troubles and I believe that everyone owes me. I hate myself, which means I don't know how to love. Well, how to live with all this. Stupid, limited, superficial, the worst thing is lazy and uninteresting. There is so much work to be done that it is utterly scary. Too many letters ...",

During his studies, he was in a terrible depression, almost did not go anywhere, did not communicate with anyone. The friends naturally pulled away. At the age of 20, I met a girl, she was 16 at that time, she was my first. I decided to part with her, now I don't remember why. She suffered greatly. Tried to contact me, but I ignored. Didn't work during training. I was very complex because of acne on my face. Received a small scholarship. All day I sat at the computer, played, watched. Mom, as it turned out later, gained a bunch of loans, loans during this time, got into a hole in debt, from which she still has not got out. I lived all this time with her. After receiving a diploma, he was taken to the army. Served a year, not good, not bad, just kind of adrift. Returned. I started to earn a little money, the work is seasonal, there is not much money. In winter, I just sat at home again. I lived like this for a year and a half. I got a cat that I could only dream of, I have not seen so much love from any living creature. This girl periodically wrote to me, but I also ignored everything. But then he answered all the same, we began to meet again. We lived for almost two years together, she left me (arguing that it is not known what will happen next, that I do not work normally and all that). Depressed again. I went to the sea, tried to communicate with someone. Two months later, another girl wrote to me (such as I imagined outwardly, the one I would like to see next to me). We began to chat, walk, and meet a little later. I got a job where I work to this day. At this time, the cat fell ill and died (as it turned out from pneumonia). We lived with this girl, for some time with me, with my mother. Then we moved in with her and her parents. We lived there for a year. She left me too. She said it would be better, I don't want to share myself, my life, my time with anyone. I moved back home, fell into a terrible depression, which I am in now.

After graduating from school, she moved to live from the village to the city. Enrolled in college. In college, in school, I was deprived of male attention. Lesson I am by nature, not thin as a chip, which is mostly loved by men. After all, men are crazy about anorexic women, but alas, I never had this when I was born.

For all the time of my worthless existence, nothing good has happened in my life. At this stage of life, there is only a cat and a loan, which is currently overdue. I do not ask for help from my relatives, I am sure that they will not understand me, and most likely even condemn me, which will remind me even more that my birth was originally a mistake of nature. I was not approved for refinancing on a loan, they say that they pay me too little. I would like to lay hands on myself, while writing the same thing in my suicide note. I am a mistake of nature.

There are many things for which I should be grateful - first of all to God, then to many people - not to mention how many. But lately, I often feel that I don't deserve all this ... I feel sometimes useless, sometimes guilty. I don’t do what I should, I don’t cope with the work as before, I waste my time, even just empty fantasizing on unpleasant topics (about diseases, etc.), although I know that this is wrong and I say to myself: "" Leave it"". But I can't, just as I can't correct myself in what I would like - on the contrary, the feeling that I'm just spoiled, no matter what I do. Otherwise, I try to do something good - for example, reconcile the quarreling friends - but I only make it worse. Sometimes it seems that my most harmless words can ... spoil a lot, although I always try to apologize in advance so as not to offend inadvertently. An almost constant feeling of guilt and a chilling fear of being wrong. They call to the boss - I cringe: what have I done wrong again? And alas, it often turns out: she really forgot something, delayed, made a mistake, did not cope with a simple task (she is absolutely not to blame for anything - she is a kind and very hardworking person). If they don't reply to my letter or something else happens that can be explained in different ways, I think that I did it again and said something wrong, that the letter is so bad that I don't deserve an answer. Unfortunately, reminders of the good that I have been given do not help at all, on the contrary. Or I feel that I am in an unpaid debt, which I will never pay off - and which I am constantly increasing. Or it becomes a shame that I cannot cope with what anyone in my place would cope with in no time; who is drowning in the sea, and I'm in a puddle, and I can't get out. It's a shame that I am so ridiculous and worthless; I even had a thought - to live so ashamed, even in words it broke ... and it scares me. I try to drive away such thoughts from myself, realizing that they are harmful ... but it does not work, and this makes me feel even more guilty and even more useless. Vicious circle.

I wore glasses and was plump. Okay, these are children. Now at my second job there are rumors and gossip about me, I have not crossed anyone's path. I have nothing to share with them. They don't talk to me, they ignore me, as soon as I leave gossip, whispering, they survive as best they can, they hanged everyone called dogs on me. I don't want to change my job, this is my second job. At the first, I did not like the new boss, and she did everything to make me leave. I feel very sorry for my mother, she raised me alone. That's also why I'm still here. She walks with a stick, except me no one will help her. Although I am also a cripple, I have arthrodesis and will now walk limp all my life. I had a beloved boyfriend, he left me a year and a half ago, they dated for three years. They wanted to get married, I loved him more than life. Fate divorced us. I tried to return it, but it was all in vain. He doesn't want to be with someone like me. And his mother and grandmother are engaged in all sorts of witchcraft things, so it seems to me they cursed me ... Although I believe in it, but after a year and a half of separation, I think about him every day, I can not imagine anyone but him next to me, alone at work failures are pursuing. For whatever I undertake, nothing happens. And I cry every day. I don’t want to live every day. It's scary to leave work, my mother and I will have nothing to live on. I endure everything and keep quiet. And I tried it in an amicable way - everything was in vain and in a bad way, it became worse only for me. There is no interest in life. Whatever and no matter how I start to do, there is failure everywhere. I have no friends. Life has divorced us. I don't have a single friend ... I share everything with my mother ... Although our relationship with her is not sugar, but I understand that it is even more difficult for her to experience what is happening to me. Because of her and hold on. But I don't want to live. I have nothing for. My beloved had to quit her studies because of work. Money is needed for existence.

Only one day has passed since the moment I left the territory of the unit and got on the train to my hometown, and I already tasted the taste of freedom, citizenship and home. It's hard for me to imagine that in 9 days I will again need to be in the unit where my home for the next 7 months will be the barracks, where again I will have to live according to this daily routine, where every step I take will be monitored, where practically everything that is on freedom, will be prohibited. In addition, in my company, I have the title of a shooter. I often mow, I brake, many people laugh at me. And it is very difficult for me to endure all this, as a very sensitive and vulnerable person. And an introvert, too. And now I am free, where there are no prohibitions, where there are no these evil colleagues, where there are no screams, where there are my own beloved parents. And I do not want to lose all this.

There, they also humiliated me, beat me, got confused to make me do something that I don't want to voice it, it's just horror. Then my mother recovered her rights and took me away (at that time I was 9 years old). Then my mother left for St. Petersburg, until I was 12 years old I lived with my grandmother. Mom came for mine and took me with her. There I studied and lived, I studied at a very decent school, I studied perfectly well. Mom also beat me, humiliated me, I started to run away from home, I really wanted to attract my mother's attention in any way. I studied well, went in for sports, did not smoke, did not drink, but it did not help me. Then I got drunk for the first time, I thought that at least so my mother would notice me, but no, she beat me again because I was in the hospital, but oh well. One fine day, my mother again raised her hand to me, but then I gave her back, I was 13 years old then. After a while we left St. Petersburg, to our hometown. During this time, I began to cut my hands, a little later I started smoking, and put out cigarettes on myself. I tried to jump off the roof, but my friends stopped me, they took me off the roof, but that didn't stop me, I went there again, but then the police took me down, my grandmother came to pick me up because I was afraid to call my mother. I was taken to a hospital (psychiatric hospital). I lay there, they stuffed me with pills, they thought it would help, but no, it didn't help. After 5 days, my mother took me. We all fought as before. Then I fell in love with a person, for a long time we were together, but this person turned out to be such a scumbag, I am so sorry that I was with him !!! I was in the (psychiatric hospital) two more times, and all for the same reason ""attempted suicide"". I had two people who supported me all this time, for this, just many thanks. For two years, I cry every night, sleep badly, and so on. I'm tired of living, I'm tired of pain, betrayal, I'm tired of life ...",
1,"Hey. My life is a complete disappointment. Briefly about myself: a guy, 16 years old, studying at a lyceum, living in a hostel. All my relationships there collapsed. I tried to help people, but people rejected me. The one I loved, on which I spent a lot of nerves and time, rejected me, my acquaintances (I don't even want to call them friends) remember me only when they need something from me. We have a hug ritual before bed. Actually, no one hugs me. Even those I help. I give food to people for free, I try to help as much as I can, but is it worth it? Maybe we need to turn into a crappy and infantile idiot, with whom our lyceum is replete? But again, I don't want that. If this happens, nothing will remain in my soul at all, and everyone will simply stop talking to me. Now, as I write this text, I have a strong desire to commit suicide. And, damn it, I think I'll find a way to do it. Help, please ...",

1," dear readers! I don’t know where to start, perhaps I’ll start with the fact that I hate myself, it sounds loud, but it’s true, the fact is that I’m not deprived of appearance, nature made fun of my appearance. You thought what happened to me? Let's start with the fact that what disgusts me most about myself is my smile, or rather my teeth, this can probably be compared with a fallen fence, which has become uneven .. and my cheeks are blushing for no reason, no matter what causes my cheeks to blush, they blush even when I bend over to tie my shoelaces or when I run a circle at the stadium, or when I need to speak in public, etc. there are a lot of examples, but I will not list them all, this ""feature"" annoys me wildly because of this I do not I can lead an active life and I can not be sociable ... will you say nonsense? But for me this is a whole disaster. I am not a teenager for a long time, but I did not have a normal relationship, and for my age this is not normal for me, my friends have already started families for a long time, some already give birth in the 2nd and even in the 3rd circle .. and I am just me, at which is unlikely to change anything in life, all my friends over and over like parrots ask the same thing, when to get married, when to give birth, these questions are already wildly enraging me, so I try not to go to meetings where everyone will only talk about the poop of my kids or about where to buy a stroller for a cheaper price. I rent a small room, I work at a modest job, I have no parents and my relatives turned their backs on me, I always felt lonely and I still feel, I tried to end my life after drinking the pills from which I am allergic, but they saved me, fortunately or unfortunately, I don’t know .. If fortunately, when will it be? I'm tired of looking happy and independent, but in my heart I really want to be loved and love, I want kids, I want tenderness, a beautiful smile, but these are just dreams that will remain with them ... Just don't say that everything will be fine, that you will meet more his man, he will love you for who you are, no need, I have heard this a thousand times and I don’t want to hear it again ... I don’t know why I am writing this here, and most importantly, what I want to hear if I have known everything for a long time myself.",

At that moment I had already resigned myself, I was thinking how my relatives and school would react to my death. And so they pulled me out. For what? Such a future? 25 years. No friends. There are no relatives. It’s even ashamed to tell me what my own mother did to me, people who were passing by probably treated me better. My father left when I was still a baby. They don't need me. No education, no work. I live in the wilderness with an old grandmother in a scary house, barely scooping up for food. There is no money even to get to the city to find a job, to replenish the account. There is no work here at all !! None at all. My boyfriend used me, but he continues to lie to have easy prey. I left him. I am alone now. No exit. It just doesn't exist. I have nightmares every day, and apparently neurosis. I don't want to live anymore. I lie down, I hardly eat, I don’t get up.

1,". I am 14 years old. I don't know if there will be responses to my story, but I need to speak out. During the last academic year, I changed two schools, because in the old one I did not like the level of education. When I left my old school, most of my friends disappeared, only two friends remained, whom I considered the best, but I rarely see them, and the dialogues on VK became monotonous. Our communication is gradually getting colder. I have a couple of acquaintances at the new school, but I don't consider them close friends. For the last week, no one has written to me, it is very difficult for me to enter VK and see that I am not interesting to anyone and is not needed. It's hard for me to be in such a killed state and I feel that I am on the verge of depression. I would like to talk to my mother, but this topic has been touched upon a hundred times and my mother is now busy planning a vacation, I do not want to distract her. It is very difficult for me without communication with my friends who were once close to me and I would like to return to my school for their sake, but I understand that I will not go anywhere with the knowledge that they give. I often think about suicide, because I feel unnecessary to people. The only thing that keeps from this is mom. I'm just a very lonely person.",

1,"I decided to write here spontaneously. I don't even know where to start. I do not have problems of serious diseases that are global in people's understanding, no one left me, I have no debts, etc. but my life is empty. I have a wonderful relationship with my mother and the rest of the family too, but for many years now I have thoughts of suicide in my head. They began to appear long ago in adolescence. more precisely, it is more likely not a desire to die but an unwillingness to live. in my life there is practically nothing good, I do not know why wake up in the morning. I study in an unloved specialty, I do not have a loved one, all my romantic hobbies do not end with anything, the guys simply do not reciprocate. but this is actually a drop in the ocean. the main problem is that I cannot find myself in this life. I always gravitated more towards creativity, but because of my fears and complexes that clung to thanks to kind people at school, I was afraid to go to the theater. some part of the brain persuades to live like everything really looks at the world, etc. and the other part requires a flight and requires something to change. but this is precisely the support from the parents that is lacking. I know that they only want the best and that we just look at life differently, but I really do not need such a life as theirs, and which I do not fully understand myself. I have constant fatigue, I do not want to wake up in the morning, everything annoys me. outwardly it is not always visible I am laughing doing something just kidding but inside I have a black hole. Yes, I understand that there are people who were happy with what I have, but that doesn't make it easier for me. we always feel only our own pain. I cry constantly. in June I have a graduation from the university from which I am sick of the specialty, too, do not like it. although I understand with my brains that I could work there, but my soul does not lie. I don't know why I wrote here, I understand that no one except myself will wash me and everything that is usually said in such situations I have already heard a hundred times and told myself. but suddenly someone really helps. because at first these thoughts scared me, but now they don't even scare me, and I understand that I am already starting to consciously think about leaving. Only my mother keeps me here, despite the fact that I did not ask me to give birth and it was her decision, but I cannot do with her. but I can't and don't want to live like that either. I don't see the point.",
1,". I decided to write here because there is no money for a psychologist, and I really need advice or, perhaps, just support. All my life I hated myself, I considered myself a scum, and I still think so. She always studied well at school, graduated with a gold medal. This is my only pride, the only thing that I could in this life. I entered the medical university, but immediately realized that it was not mine. Two years of torment, I just have depression now, from which I cannot get out. I can only re-enroll in a clinical psychologist, but this, according to others, is futile. I cry every day. The family has no money, I don't dress very well, my mother spends her last money on paying me a rented apartment. And this despite the fact that we have four mothers. Young people don't even look at people like me. Outwardly ordinary, poorly dressed, it is clear that from an unsecured family. We met men over 30 - they used it only, I think, it is clear how. I envy when I look at girls of the same age: someone has an appearance, wealth, brains ... I have nothing. Lately I miss the university, I just can't get up and do something. I hate myself for that. I think about suicide all the time. Sometimes it seems that even pity for the family is gone. I always thought that they would be better off without me. Thanks.",

I also collected money from tables and nightstands, which was bad. then the real theft of money from my grandmother's wallet began. And at first it was not enough, and then it went on and on. Now I'm already 13. And I really don't understand what is happening to me. And what to do. Then it was money for garbage like food, etc. d But I took money for clothes from Aliexpress and for food. And I don't know what to do. I read it, I found out that stealing is a sin. But you know, I can't just come up and say that I took money for about 2 years. I really want to, But I am terrified. I have a good family, well-to-do. I have clothes and everything I need. But why I started stealing, I don't know. How to repent? Go to church and tell my father, then everything will be forgiven me? I remember 11-12 years old my relationship was not the best, and then I didn't care what I took from whom. But I understand that if I don't tell my grandmother myself, then all my life I will sob and regret that I did not say then. Tell me what to do? Go to church or find strength and tell my grandmother.

1,"I don't know what to do with the fact that I hate myself. It started from childhood, and already as a habit. Blame yourself for everything. I have a good life, I have a mom, I have a chance to get a good education, buddies. But I hate myself and sometimes it's terrible. First of all, I hate myself for the appearance and for the fact that I can't do anything. My weight is 62 with a height of 162, I'm only 14. My classmates are all skinny and very often make comments to me about my obesity. It really hurts. It is very difficult to go to physical-oh, because it seems that everyone is looking at me and thinking, ""God, what a fat woman?"" Now we are jumping over the goat, and I am very afraid when my turn will come. That I can't and everyone will start laughing at me. I can't lose weight, I constantly break down. If something bad happens, they start to worry and eat it with food. I go to fitness, but there's little use. Sometimes thoughts creep in, but can you stop it all? Just commit suicide <ed. Mod.>? I am madly jealous of those who already have guys. I really want to be loved as much as they are loved. But I know that this will not happen. Sometimes it seems to me that I will be alone all my life and die alone. I do not know what to do. I really want to go to Japan. Learn to be a translator. But I already doubt that I can. I am very selfish and quick-tempered. Hypocritical. I hate myself for that. I hate myself for everything. Recently, in a fit of anger, I tore my hand in blood. I tried to talk to my mother about it, but she just brushed it off and said that all this is a transitional age and will pass. All promises to reduce to a nutritionist, but these are only promises. Now she has big debts, as her father dumped, taking with him almost all the money. Freak, I hate him. Dirty pig. I try not to impose on her, because I know how hard it is for her. There are so many thoughts in my head ... I just need help. For someone to hug and say that they love me the way I am. I hate myself. Dirty pig.",

Then I began to increase the amount of the game, in the end I lost my credit card for 160,000. By that time I had a family, I did not dare to tell my wife. He stopped playing for a year, spent the whole year looking for money for a credit card so that his wife would not know. As a result, he took a loan from the bank to pay off the credit card, repaid everything and began to lose again in the hope of recouping. I lost everything again, but the debt was already 600,000. I decided to tell everything to my wife, but she was afraid to stay with me and I do not accuse her of anything and understand. At work, I saw how they make bets, I was interested and tried to see the easy money. I went to the bank and took out a loan of 700,000 rubles, and in the end I lost everything safely in two months. Then life went from paycheck to paycheck. I lost my salary in a couple of days, or even an hour. I lost everything I pressed, moved to my parents, they believed me, helped me a little financially to pay off their microloans, which I also managed to pick up. In the end, I decided to quit, everything seemed to start to turn out, life was getting better, my favorite plans for the future appeared. But debts of one and a half million were not given to hope for something, he again began to play in the hope of winning back the money. Everything began to work out, I believed in myself, but as they say, greed ruined the frayer. As a result, they borrowed more money to distribute debts, but I lost it again, hoping to win. Now I sit and think to commit suicide, I lost my life. Once again I lost my salary, borrowed more from friends, I also leaked everything.

I want to get into the car (but first I have to take it somewhere) and get rid of all these two-faced scum that surround me, or just drive it into the wall. Of my friends, I only have school friends, with whom I rarely communicate, because they have their own life. Some new people (who may be trying to make friends with me) I do not believe, no matter what they do for me, at best I have them I will not perceive it as a threat to myself. Nobody understands that if I like to relax alone and hate companies, this does not mean that I do not want to communicate with anyone, in the company I just get tired very quickly (pressure, headache, fog in my head, etc.) I do not understand). In short, a typical introvert. I never had a girlfriend, I did not go out with anyone, because nobody needs uncommunicative silent people. I can’t talk normally with a person if I don’t know his character well. And I want a normal attitude from people, as a person, and not garbage. And then I feel like some kind of biomass, which prevents everyone from living. I am constantly asked that a young handsome man has not married yet? I would like to kill for such questions. Even my relatives also think about me that I don't need communication. I am sometimes asked why I am like this. Do I know ?? I'm an experienced psychiatrist? I myself don’t understand what’s wrong with me. How is it simple for others, but I can’t do anything? That is, if I try to get acquainted, they send me away.

I could not. I went to my mother, my mother lives in an urban-type settlement with her sister. There is no work for me and no place in the kindergarten. Mom said that we would not be pulled. In essence, there is nowhere to go. Shivers at the thought that I can return to my husband. To go to the city, you have to rent a house, but there is no money. And where is the child? The queue hasn't come yet. Despair. Thinking about suicide",

I am alone all the time, even being with friends, with a loved one, with loved ones. I see no reason to live, just nothing. Nothing works out in college. I try to do something, but however, not everything goes so smoothly. Recently, I have become completely lazy. I dive into myself and hate myself for it with all my heart, remembering my past, remembering how I betrayed, lied to people dear to me. Everyone is so beautiful, smart, they achieve everything. I'm just me. I can’t do either, I don’t know anything. Yes, my self-esteem is nearing the very bottom. There is one problem in me that I cannot control. I like to talk to myself and because of this, many suffer. I have friends, there are those with whom you can talk, but talking with myself gives me some strength, self-confidence. I am a sick person, I need to be isolated from other people who are more normal than me. I need to go straight to the psychiatric hospital, I need to get rid of me. And perhaps the only way is to die. Yes, I don't think about my parents anymore. And even that I love more than anything else ... I don't want to live, that's all. I tried to strangle myself, cut myself, beat myself. But I cannot kill myself completely ... Because of this I suffer. Please help me please what to do. At least some steps towards happiness and meaning. At least just attention, I would be very grateful for that. I love life, but I can't stand myself.",

Nothing interesting. I also can't cry. That makes it even worse. Husband. left and sued his daughter. Now she lives with him. And he found another woman. I live with my parents. Father thinks I am crazy and constantly reproaches me for this. Recently I heard a conversation between my father and my sister that if I do not give injections , then I will kill someone from the family. The daughter comes to me for the weekend. But my ex-husband does not allow her to study with her. She says that I will be with my dad, I cannot be with my mother. So I live like a vegetable, not feeling no emotions. Plus everything from the injections my whole body weakened. I put on a few kilograms. I can’t live a full life. This world is not in sorrow and not in joy. I would like to live a normal life, as before. So I think to commit suicide. I’m no use. I’m just dragging home-work-home. I don’t do anything else. On weekends I lie for days.

1,", my name is Christina, I am 16 years old. For 2 years I have been living with obsessive thoughts of suicide, so this time for me is a real hell. I have quite a few mental illnesses, but the main one is personality disorder. Life is simply unbearable, every day is a continuous torture, incredible pain in my soul, constant tears, tantrums and every time I feel that I am slowly dying, turning into a living corpse ... my soul just groans in pain ... So, now I just became obsessed with the thought kill myself, just recently there was a suicide attempt, I jumped out the window, the person was not hurt .. Almost all my friends and class teacher found out about this, she saw my farewell note, but did nothing about it, after my failure, I tried to find at least one person to share their pain. In general, I began to communicate with her, came during recess, wrote Messages on the phone that I could no longer live with this, that it was better to lie in the ground, etc. But she reacted to this rather frivolously, did not attach much importance, and yet I entrusted this to her alone, and to none of the adults. She didn't even trust the psychiatrist, she said that everything is fine with me ... and then bam and opened up to this person ... in short, everyone just spit on me, friends are just as uninterested in it, no one in my life communicates with me, I am always alone , and everyone is just discussing behind my back .. For a long time I have been suffering from severe depression, neuroses, sometimes I am tormented by unexpected anxiety, fear for no apparent reason. Very often I cut my hands in an attempt to somehow block my mental pain ... but it's useless. Now I seriously began to think about the pills, just to get drunk on them and that's it, to die in peace .. I have a difficult relationship with my parents, my dad left the family recently, my mother is nervous. It is very painful for me to live like this, it is simply unrealistic. The most offensive thing is that everyone looks only at material factors, they say, you have everything, live and be happy, but they do not understand what it means when the soul hurts. When you can't even get out of bed. I feel like just bio-waste. Even in the days of death groups, I tried to join there, and did, but then they were all banned. Now, I'm ready to say goodbye to everyone once and for all, I have nothing more to lose ...",

They said that it was my fault, I gave a non-working phone. But everyone calls me, there are no missed ones, the phone is working, why they didn't get through - I don't know. They told me, and I cried into the phone. I could not restrain myself, I spoke through tears, and they lectured me. Like a little girl. So ashamed, the feeling that I was disgraced. That I really am to blame, and am not capable of anything, that everyone is against me, and I am alone. Now I will quit without even working. And what will they think of me, where the internship took place ... And I will look for work again. Before my first job I had been looking for vacancies for almost 2 years, and during that period every day I wanted to die. I felt so bad, in this suspended state of uncertainty, and my parents reproached me for not working. I have psychological problems, I have depression, I am very afraid of people, severe weakness, it is difficult for me to engage in activities. The pills do not help, there is no money for therapy, because there is no work. I am afraid that that time will happen again, I will again look for work for a long time, and I will fall into a swamp of despair. I'm afraid I won't be able to stand that nightmare again.

I thought I’d go to work now as some kind of waiter and then we’ll see, well, then I realized that I’m just afraid. In personal life, too, everything is terrible. There was one guy, we grew up with him, I don't know or I loved him, he was a good friend to me in the beginning, my conscience gnaws until now that this happened because of my stupidity. Then another appeared, from the beginning we were just friends for 3 months, we became very close, those days that we were together were the best, I could tell him what I could not tell others, he said that he liked it, but then I could not understand what I was I feel him then he left, and from that moment I feel terribly bad, we hardly communicate, although I used to write every day. and I once said that I felt something for him, he made a joke. Recently I congratulated you on March 8th ... the most funny. I tried to forget him, but half a year has passed and I can't, every day I think about this person and it makes me sick, bad, but I pretend that everything is fine, I smile and laugh. I am even ashamed to tell this to someone, because I understand what an absurd situation is from the outside. I am not an amorous person, I do not like anyone and it seems to me that I will be left alone, useless to anyone.

At school I was very calm and harmless, so I did not feel much aggression in my direction. They could just laugh behind their backs, no more. There weren't many girlfriends. We did not live richly, there was no money for fashionable clothes. And I guess I stood out among my classmates. They often laughed at me. And the boys did not pay attention to me at all. I never told anyone about my problems, my parents would still start blaming me for everything. Mom was ashamed of me.

Things only got worse. I left for another city and entered the university. I decided to start a new life. I changed my hairstyle, changed my wardrobe. But nothing has changed.

I took her money so that she would remove the damage. It all started in 2011. For 7 years, my mother took out all the gold, took loans for herself, me and my grandmother. The total amount of loans from my mother is about $ 2000 in 7 different banks. My grandmother has about $ 3000, I have $ 3000 in 2 banks and 12 small loans in different fin. institutions. Delays have already begun, threats are coming every day. The situation is heating up every day. In addition to loans, the mother took money from all her acquaintances. She lied to everyone that she took for a new apartment and she took it to a gypsy woman. She borrowed money at interest. In some she took to cover the interest of others. This is everything lasted until the situation escalated and the truth began to come out. The amount of debts exceeds $ 50,000. Sometimes it requires at least parts to be given, but there is not enough money whatever. Several people were taken to other people at a lower percentage to earn. In this lie, a person is involved 15 and different sums for everyone, someone $ 2000, someone $ 7000, and so on. There is also one person (a bandit) who has a debt of $ 15,000. He takes our house and a kiosk in the market where I work, sell souvenirs. The house is divided into 2 halves, in one I live, my mother and grandmother, in the other my uncle (my mother brother) and his daughter. They do not know about all these problems and they will also have to leave the house. The total income of my mother and grandmother is $ 1000 per month. How not cool money is not enough.

Several years ago, my daughter and I left the village for the city, my daughter is engaged in music, and in the village I did not have the opportunity to carry her. Yes, and I wanted to try to find myself in life, maybe meet a man, but apparently everything is really in our head, I can't, I didn't teach. I got a job, spent a lot of time at work, was very tired, came, even couldn't talk to my daughter. What kind of personal life can we talk about, a sense of duty to a child, pride, vanity, cowardice, laziness, inability to live within our means helped me to get in into credit bondage and now I don’t know what to do, I have overdue all possible payments, I don’t know what I’ll pay for the apartment, I’m trying to find a job, but what to do now, they call from the bank, demand payment of payments. I understand that everything is happening now will only benefit me, I hope that I will learn to manage finances competently and live within my means. The worst thing about all this, for which I reproach myself, is that my daughter lives by such a terrible example, sees me always unhappy, and in fact, most likely she will live according to the same principle (scenario). In general, everything in my life is not right from A to Z. I understand this and do not know how to fix it. I can't bring myself to go to church, I had a sad experience, if it's bad, I'd better pray at home, my family has nothing to help me, they have their own problems, I am very ashamed, worried that they will start calling them. I don't think they will understand me. I read many articles on this site about such situations, I understand that everything is temporary and will pass, but it's so hard. I apologize for such a pun.",

In my opinion, squalor. There have always been very few friends, and even then I don't communicate much with them. There is no girl and never was (who needs me with such a bouquet of non-masculine qualities?). There are problems at work, I'm afraid they might kick me out of there at all, because at the moment I'm the worst employee there.

1,"I am 18. There is no interest in life at all. I don’t think it’s because of the age. The main problem is my appearance: I just have a huge forehead that occupies half of my face, a large nose (which I don't consider critical, but nevertheless), different ears (one normal, the other, so to speak, protruding), thin lips, but the most the main drawback is an incorrect bite, which terribly spoils the face, while delivering other inconveniences, such as slurred speech and difficulty eating. Unfortunately, there is no money to fix this. Until recently, I wanted to unlearn and find a good job, make money and correct shortcomings. But for a year now I have no motivation for any action at all. I went to school, showed promise, won Olympiads, studied perfectly well. But then I lost all desire to study completely, I stopped studying, going to school. That is why: my classmates frankly consider me scary (as well as my relatives), they themselves walk, meet someone, give flowers to my classmates, invite them to the cinema, etc. In short, they live and rejoice, they are happy, they are beautiful. They enjoy youthfulness and carelessness. But not me. And looking at this whole scene, I realized that I have no need to study, just as there is no need to live, because no one needs me, I have no friends, that is, now there is no joy in life. I thought about how many years it would take to study, get a job, save money, and then wear braces for a few more years. Thinking about all this discouraged the desire to move on. Why work, work, if appearance is the most important thing for a girl. Life is definitely easier for beautiful girls. For example, my beautiful classmate from a poor family found herself a wealthy guy who had already proposed to her, in no case I do not want to find myself the same guy, but I cannot but note that her life was better, she is happy. I don’t even threaten to get married or just have a boyfriend, I don’t even dream of a family. As soon as I tried to create motivation for myself, I can’t. There is no desire to do anything. Plus, family problems. Quite serious. And Mom is not even interested in my life. One day I overheard a conversation between my relatives, which seriously affected my self-esteem. During this conversation, my aunt said that she did not like me at all, that I was terrible, and in general was born in vain. In a word, I'm lonely, joyless, bored. I urgently need motivation in my life, otherwise I will simply disappear. Perhaps someone has come across this, help me find the slightest desire to move on. Now I do not want anything at all, I do not need anything, I see no reason to continue my life, just as I was repeatedly visited by thoughts of suicide.",

1,". I have had bulimia and anorexia for almost 15 years now. Over the years, social phobia, neuroses, and OCD have intensified. I live with my father part of the year, the other part - with a guy in another city. I have no friends, because of constant travel, I work online, I hardly leave my house. After the last treatment for anorexia, I gained 20 kg and fell into a terrible depression. I can't look at myself, I starve, then I overeat and vomit. This is not the first or even 10 times, and I was tired to death. Health is poor, weight loss is more and more difficult. There is no support from the outside, the psychiatrist only prescribes the next drugs. There is no special relationship with my mother since the age of 13, when she left us. Which is good, for she was a tyrant. Every day I think about death. I had happy periods in my life, but thoughts about them only hurt more, because I left some close people myself, and the rest ran away, tk. I'm in constant depression, but I'm tired of ""having fun in public"", so at first I just postponed meetings until I realized that I was all alone. There is simply no one around, never. And it seems to me that my life is already over. I had dreams of family, children, travel. Simple dreams about a normal active life.

1,"I want to kill myself and my father is pushing me to do it in every possible way. I understand what the business man has done, that he is to blame for everything, but he still shouts at me every day and asks me to go and kill myself. The fact is that in the fall I was first deported from China, where I studied for 7 years (for using marijuana), and this winter I started working with Bitcoins on the exchange and I was very good at it. My father took a loan and gave me $ 30,000 so that I would spin them, then there were investors who gave me another $ 150,000. everything was fine, I made a lot of money, I put it off, I wanted to return it to my father, but everything changed on that fateful night in the casino. I went with two friends to a casino and started playing. Before that, I also played, but very little and did not really know how. That day I arrived prepared with money in my pocket and immediately lost $ 8000 I was so angry with myself I needed to win everything back and I flew to another casino there I lost another $ 20,000 it was a fiasco .. I just didn't know what to do everything going round and round I flew home. At night I sat and thought how to quickly put them in their place, because I promised to return them. everything was very deplorable on the exchange, all cryptocurrencies were falling and falling nothing was growing it was impossible to work. And one evening I remembered about one online casino where I had played before, but in little things, now I decided to climb in big so that I could win back everything that I lost at once. One by one I was losing bitcoins as if I were playing for small amounts and by the morning I had lost not only all my money but also the money of my father and investors. The next day, the investors found out about everything and took me to the notary to draw up a loan agreement. After that, I flew to my hometown to look for money. They ignored my request not to tell my father and immediately told him everything about me. They told how we lived in grand style, flew abroad, what I did and how I lost money. It just killed Father and Mom ... all I bring to our family is one disappointment. I can't live with this, my father will have to sell part of the property so that I would not go to jail. Although he says that he will not get involved here for me, I know what will happen and this will hit the family's financial condition very hard. I cannot live with it every day, only the stories about the grief of my family after the loss of a loved one from this site help me to restrain myself. But I feel that I won't last a couple more days of my father's visits like this and I will commit suicide <ed. Mod.>. I had thoughts of leaving home, but the fear of what my father would do to me if he found me and the fear of going to jail haunts me. I will 100% sit for 7 years if I do not pay in two weeks.

1,", I would like to write my life story, because I have no more strength. I got confused in myself, became very unsure - and in relation to people and situations, angry, envious. But this state, I very often experience in myself, I have a husband who supports me as much as he can, but along the way I became so sick that his help does not add confidence to me. I'll start with my childhood. I had a rather dysfunctional family, my father and mother drank heavily, we had four children, but the eldest did not live with us. It was very difficult, but at that time, I was not yet very aware of the hard life, since I was a child, then, as we moved to my grandmother, she deprived her parents of her rights and became a guardian. Mother stayed with us, father moved to his mother. In the fifth grade, I became a black sheep, there was a boy from a parallel class who began to spread rot, insult me, and in every possible way play off most of the students against me, since I did not look like many, a quiet, squeezed, kind of victim. In general, these bullying became my life, during the day at school, and in the evening at home where the abuse of my grandmother and a drunken mother, and I got so used to the role of the victim that to this day I'm 25, I think very darkly, it is so hard for me to communicate with people , and if before I pissed everyone off with isolation, now it’s probably more rude, uncertainty. I have become so unperceived that thoughts of suicide come to me, although I already had the experience of committing suicide, and if it were not for a friend who unexpectedly came to visit me, I would not have been. I cannot complain, I have an apartment and a loving husband for everything, I only complain about myself, I have not received an education, for the same reason as at school, now at home, I am looking for a job, but fear is sitting, for my time has changed a bunch of work, and the latter was generally one continuous test and nervous tension. I believe in God, and prayers make it easier for me, but sometimes in my brain, something switches, and I begin to think why God does not help me, etc. I became very lazy, I cannot do something once again, for example, around the house There are no special talents, there is a small craving, I like at home when there is no one to dance, but I’ll hardly start doing it, firstly age, secondly finances, thirdly why, just dance in the studio without any promotion, I don't see the point I began to cry often, which probably strongly depends on the human assessment, but I can't get out of the vicious circle, there is not much money for psychologists, so if anyone can help me at least here",

It mixes with the pain of the loss of a loved one ... They lose their nerves after a scandal with a girl, a suicide attempt is not successful. How he got away from the suicide attempt, the girl simply threw it into the blackout. Tears from the pain of the soul, apparently, the chosen method - it was not serious.

But I am fat from early childhood (80 kg at 158 ​​cm), and not entirely of my own free will, but due to illness. As a result, my insulin is increased, I need to lose weight, otherwise there will be diabetes, they prescribed pills, but I cannot drink them! If I drink them, I can’t eat anything, I just can’t fit a piece into myself. I stop taking pills - I am eating as if not into myself. As a result, neither loose clothing, nor full control of emotions in public, nor love to chat helped to get rid of the ridicule of peers. I don't give a damn about them, thanks for not laughing in the face, but I hate my body. And absolutely weak-willed, I cannot change anything. And just the other day, I naturally went crazy. Just for 2 hours in a row I thought about what kind of creature I am, how we can exist and stuff like that. And that was the last straw.

He began to write SMS, begging for forgiveness. She's not in any. She is a very beautiful and intelligent girl. And of course there are many worthy men around her. She quickly stepped over me and went on to build her life. My pleas, which eventually turned into a pitiful whine, had no result. I never thought I could break like that. I fell into a severe depression, when it is difficult even to get out of bed. Antidepressants and antipsychotics do not help. Every second the thought of her and what I did is spinning in my head. Guilt eats away at the brain and body. I sleep for a couple of hours on sleeping pills. I was a strong man, but after going through a lot of difficulties I would not think that I would break down like that from losing my relationship. Life without her has no meaning. 5 months have passed. The pain does not subside but, on the contrary, gets stronger. A sluggish desire to commit suicide every second. Completely lost performance. I see no point in working. As a result, at work they saw my swollen state, eyes that went out like a dog's, you can't hide it from people. The team feels who and what they are. Never drank. But here every day I pour myself on the rest of the money. As a result, they asked me to come from work. Mom seems to feel what is happening to me and says - it's good that you're alive, hold on. I don’t want to live. I want to die. I have done so much that I will never forgive myself. I would like to cease my existence, disappear into nothingness, forget my eternal sleep or go to another life, and so that the past life is not remembered. It's too hard. I suffer too much. Guilty myself. Bad temper and evil tongue. Lord forgive me for my sins, I am guilty and want to leave.",
1,"Я нахожусь в глубокой депрессии уже более двух лет. Вся моя жизнь это череда неудач, собственных глупостей и непонимание со стороны близких да и общества в целом. Все началось с того, что я потерял маму в 13 лет. Это была врачебная ошибка, тяжёлая операция и в последствии смерть. Но это уже было давно. Я живу с отцом и бабушкой, которая живёт от нас отдельно. И все моё детство меня упрекали за многие провинности. Мне часто говорили, что я все делаю не правильно, что у меня ничего не получится, что я не поступлю в университет и тд. Я окончил школу, смог поступить в желаемый вуз. Но это не сильно изменило отношение ко мне. Суть в том, что меня по сей день ругают за ошибки прошлого. Да, я был не самым хороши подростком, но и не самым плохим. Я не спился, не сторчался, у меня было обычное детство и отрочество. Школа, друзья, дом, улица, интернет. Обычный подросток. Но опять же, за все мои ошибки меня до их пор почти ненавидят, особенно бабушка. Её может понести так, что она говорит мне ужасные вещи. Мне очень неприятно слышать это от близкого человека. Что именно она говорит, это не так важно. Образно,  это то что я в этой жизни никто, что у меня все не так и вообще я живу без смысла, ну и все в таком духе. Отец более лоялен, конечно я благодарен ему за все, он принимает меня таким, какой я есть, но я мало чувствую от него поддержки. Ну то есть большинство моих проблем, с которыми я делюсь, он пытается выставить это как жизненный урок для меня. Когда в этот момент мне нужно что-то...другое, он перефразирует это жизненный опыт, мол жизнь будет ещё бить и это нормально. И как бы меня по жизни никто не жалел практически. Единственная искренняя  радость это мои друзья, с которыми я общаюсь уже очень давно. Если бы не они, то я просто не знаю что бы я делал. И вот к своим 19 годам, я замечаю что я очерствлел. Мне сложно выражать эмоции, жалеть кого-то, потому что как я считаю, что возможно меня не долюбили в детстве. Но это ладно, мне уже не привыкать, я как-то справлюсь один. В последний раз бабушка довела меня до нервного срыва. Она наговорила лишнего и меня просто сорвало. Я убежал на улицу и просто был вне себя от злости и обиды. Просто вот рассказываю я почему все. Сейчас у меня ещё более тяжёлый период в жизни. Прошлым летом я сломал ногу и сейчас отстал по учёбе. Меня дома все время подгонят сдавать долги, все время говорят что меня выгонят. При этом у меня есть денежные трудности. Я пытаюсь со своей ногой  (сейчас она уже более мение и я хожу) успевать работать, учится. Все это очень трудно, когда у тебя ещё и дома ничего хорошего не ждёт. И мне очень плохо уже второй год. Ничего не меняется, говорит с домашними без полезно, у них один аргумент - это то что я совершил ошибки в прошлом и за них мне должно быть стыдно. По этому я такая гадость и вообще позор семьи. Да, мне стыдно за все, но ведь жизнь не стоит на месте. Нельзя все время обижаться, тем более в нашей небольшой семье. И я ничего не могу поделать. Почти каждый день ругаемся, причём я часто не понимаю почему. Я далеко не дурак, но никто не видит моих достижений и увлечений. Но если они этого не видят, это не значит, что я просто пуст. У меня много увлечений, я прочитал множество книг самостоятельно. И замечаю, что мыслю немного поиному в отличии от моих сверстников. Но это не важно, просто хочу добавать, что я умею думать и анализировать вполне серьёзно. И мне чет окончательно все достало и просто опускаются руки",

1,", my name is Vladimir and a misfortune happened in my life, I fell into an abyss called a crisis, from which I do not have the courage to get out. Last year I was expelled from the institute, I took an academic leave and started working, I did not despair. This year the situation is the same, I could not cope with debts, sociopathy and the result was depression and crisis. 2.5 months have passed since that time, but I still cannot gather my courage and tell my parents about it. For them I study and I am doing well. I know that this cannot be so forever, and circumstances do not allow and conscience eats. But all this time I promise myself to find the strength in myself and tell everything. And you know what? I forget myself and cannot find the courage in myself. All 2.5 months I wander the streets, entrances, friends, hotels. The money is almost out. I'm in despair, it's cold outside and I want to freeze somewhere ... I really don't want to live. I just can't muster up the courage to do it, I'm afraid of my family's reaction to the second fall. Lost in a lie to his family and to himself. Suicide seems like a solution, and hysteria sometimes becomes a normal state. I think the situation is hopeless at times. I tried to find unity in prayer and I see how God helps me and hints to decide and everything will be fine. But I'm still afraid. I myself am probably to blame for this phobia. In general, the more I am silent, the more problems and even thinking about it is unbearable. Thank you for attention",

1,"I am 30, I am an anesthesiologist-resuscitator. I went to this work for a long time and consciously. I wanted to help people. She graduated from the university with honors. After the 5th year, she got married, was planning a child, the pregnancy was unsuccessful - it froze at 7 weeks. After graduation, we went to work under the Zemsky Doctor program - the state pays 1,000,000, for which you work in the countryside for 5 years. I have been working for 1.5 years, for the last 5 months I have been acting as a manager. The department has about 12 middle and junior staff and 3 more doctors - all older than me. With the money we received, we bought an apartment in a big city, we also took out a loan, since 1/5 of the amount was still not enough. The purchase was unsuccessful, the house was rented out, but the apartment was arrested due to double sales, the trial lasts a year - as a result, we pay the loan for our own nerves. At work, I go to hell every day, and sometimes I don't leave it, there are 32-hour shifts. The situation is terrible, in addition to the working moments, which are extremely tragic, the atmosphere in the hospital itself is simply horrible - there are many incompetent scandalous doctors who do not know how and do not want to fulfill their duties, a minimum of treatment and examination opportunities. I am by nature a calm and well-mannered person, but every day I have to listen to screams and insults and answer, otherwise no one will simply hear you and will not follow your instructions (refers to nurses). The contingent in the village is also peculiar, a lot of energy goes into swearing with relatives, and the leadership is always not on your side. Every morning starts with a wish that this is all over, every evening I want to close my eyes and never open them again. Life is unbearable. I have a hobby and I am interested in many things, but I simply do not have time for this, physically I have no strength. Work sucks all of me, plus the shift - the eternal lack of sleep, at home only enough strength to crawl to bed. My relationship with my husband soured, I am offended that he does not understand me, for him all my problems are empty. We are planning a pregnancy, but I understand that there can be no pregnancy in such a state. And I'm also very afraid that everything will happen again - it will definitely ""finish off"" me. Those close to me also see that I am on the edge - but all their instructions such as live and be happy with what is - they hurt me. It is also very painful to think that maybe everything is really good with me, it's just that I'm kind of defective ... When I was 17, I already had a suicide attempt - because of difficult relationships with my parents. I want to live, but definitely not this life - to open my eyes and forget everything like a bad dream, a life where I am happy, where I love my job, where I am understood, where I not only give, but also receive support from my loved ones.

1,"I am depressed. After leaving home four years ago due to the war, I started to feel depressed. All four years in a row we have been pumping from city to city, from place to place. At first I wanted to go home wildly. Just home. Due to the sharp climate change, due to separation from friends, due to the fact that she was among the children of another country and did not get along with their mentality. She closed herself off from everyone. She endured mockery from her younger sister and classmates, the family experienced serious financial difficulties due to renting apartments and paperwork, trying to distract herself with creativity: drawing, making appliqués, learning to crochet toys. Sometimes inspiration rushes in and I don't need anyone for weeks. But there were also moments of crisis. In difficult times, there was no one to talk to, even the elementary "", how are you?"" And I decided that I didn't need anyone, that I hate everyone. And she stopped talking. Only at a minimum: ""yes"", ""no"", ""don’t know"". I sat for days at school, until the evening sat up at school. But because of personal hostility to me, the ""beggar,"" teachers were thrown down. I finished eighth and ninth with almost two marks. My sister made me angry on purpose, and I am a peaceful person, but when I see that they are trying to make me angry, I quickly become inflamed. I wanted to beat her and sometimes to such an extent that when I was alone, I began to scream and beat against the walls. Stuck sweet stress and put on seven kilograms. Dad poked me at my weight, albeit not so much with malicious intent, as with an attempt to stir me up (she sat at home and did not go anywhere except school / store). The weight was very difficult to take. I tried to lose weight, but in the end I only planted my last health. We moved several times, which is why we had to finish the ninth grade again. Now I'm finishing the tenth. From the very beginning of the year I go to school almost hysterical. Do not want and that's it. I don't like crowded places. I can't bring myself to study a little. I don’t know who to apply for and what subjects to prepare for. All interest in life has disappeared. I don’t draw, I don’t knit, I don’t walk, I don’t watch any films or TV shows, I don’t cook, I don’t take an interest in the muses of the bands I was crazy about before. I constantly think that everything I do is ugly. That my hands are from the last place and all my works are worthless. That no one cares about my opinion. That I am an extra person in this world. It seems to me that the desire to do something will never return to me. For the last 2 months I have been suffering from a headache, often throwing things and yelling at the dog, which is why I then start to hate myself. Before, I just thought that I should wait and everything will pass and I didn't want to die. A week ago I understood. Sick of all. I want to die. I don't see the point and have no desire to live on.

1,". I grew up in a large family, the eldest of eight. I don't know if this somehow influenced the formation of my problem, so to speak. But after finishing four classes I was transferred to home schooling and I was in social isolation for a long time. From the age of 16, complexes began to appear, obsession with certain thoughts, events, even insignificant ones. Probably, this is due to the transitional age, but now I am 21, and nothing has changed, only emotions have dulled. I never understood why I exist at all and what to do with this life. There was no foundation, no goal, no vector on which my actions and problem solving would be based. I entered the institute, if only what, I don't know why, but just in case. I got a job at the same time, because they never gave me money, but what I earn I spend is often completely pointless and useless, because, in essence, I don't know what to spend. I postpone some part, just to be, again. So absolutely in all actions - there is no real reason for them, I act automatically. In communicating with others, sometimes I did not notice manipulative techniques, which were later pointed out to me. An ex-girlfriend said that I change my mind too often. Because, in essence, I do not have my own opinion on any matter, except that the above is not normal. Lately I have not felt anything, I have even forgotten how to cry. Running away from problems every second. And from problems, and from myself. Pointless communication on the network (those people with whom, by chance, it turned out to establish contact in life, already leave me, and I understand everything), meaningless consumption of content, which does not even bring pleasure, but drowns out the inner cycle of thoughts. And this cycle leads only to one thing - it is necessary in the end to make up your mind and kill yourself. Thoughts of suicide began to haunt the age of 16, and the grounds for it became deeper and deeper. For a while I thought that it was enough to start leading a completely independent life, and the only problem is that. Therefore, I moved from my parents for six months, but nothing has changed, absolutely. I have dealt with household chores before, but the questions ""what now? Why? Where? Who are you?"" still tormented me persistently. I resorted to various kinds of psychotropic substances, so that, again, not to think, to run away. But at some point, they no longer saved, but only made things worse, so he stopped. My parents are religious people, Jehovah's Witnesses, and naturally, they wanted me to follow in their footsteps, but this is very difficult. This seems to me to be self-deception. I tried to escape into religion as well. I talked with believers, went to meetings / church. It did not work out to take religious structures seriously.",

1,"In the 8th grade we started chemistry. It was taught by a teacher who had just graduated from college. This year in terms of chemistry was excellent, almost the entire class had 5. This year the teacher went on maternity leave, another one came to us, from the lyceum, and she was under 70. As it turned out, we had failures in chemistry. That is, we seem to understand what's what, but not well enough. And this was the case for the whole parallel. We tried to explain to her that we didn’t go through some topics at all, and some simply didn’t understand, to which she replied that “she looked at the textbook and there it is, so you don’t believe it, you went through”. She asked, no one knew, put deuces, asked again and put deuces again. Often gives tests, it's just a pity the chance to get 5 for them simply does not exist. She gave us one test before explaining a new topic. It's just a pity that he was on a new topic. Others had things we just didn't know, and she explained in the next lesson. She explained to explain, only the task was not completed correctly — 3. And she also gives us tests from the book ""Inorganic Chemistry"" by Shmakov. And all would be fine, only we study according to the Federal State Educational Standard and we have a modified program, and the tests are a little bit 2002, and it's 2018 ... And in these tests, a third is not in our textbooks. 2/3 of the tests, correctly performed, is 3. I somehow stretched the first trimester to 4, in this I have 3, it is not possible to fix it.

I'm not even talking about the fact that I'm unrealistically lonely, and any communication always involves expenses.

Now I am forever attached to that state and to someone else's pity, instead of taking up my lost education, trying to go back to school, I read forums, pray and do nothing.

1,"I will not start with long prefaces, my story is not the shortest anyway. For three years now, I feel so bad from time to time that I don't want to live. At such moments, I cut my hands, but only in order to reduce the pain. I have carved many places for myself in the past year. Parents saw only cuts on their hands, or rather scars. It may seem to the reader that they just noticed it late. But this is not the case. They wouldn't have noticed if it hadn't been for my sister, who was visiting for the summer (in college). I will say that I myself showed them to my father before. He only said that he would be more careful and softer in his expressions with me. Now I am in the 9th grade, life goes on as usual. ~ 6 months ago my girlfriend left me ... We met with her on the Internet (met for half a year). After that everything went to hell, I could not find a place for myself, I don’t remember what happened after that. But my orientation was already accepted by my parents, they resigned themselves, we just do not talk about it. Now I have absolutely no idea where to go after graduation. It's not an option to go to 10 - with grades like mine, they won't be accepted to school, or to many colleges. I want to go to art school, well, theoretically, I would be very happy - but in reality, I simply don't know what I want. But I know that now I don't want to live. I don’t want to live, I don’t want to die, because there are so many beautiful things in the world, I haven’t done a lot of things ... At first glance, I am a very cheerful girl, my friends like my witty jokes, I communicate with people a lot. But when I come home and I'm alone in the room, I only feel empty. Often I just watch cartoons or TV shows. I don't know how to tell my parents that I need help. My sister also drank antidepressants, and is a ""nutty fool"" for parents, and I am an angel in the flesh. This, too, weighs immensely. Mother wants to shove not all where, I absolutely do not understand what is happening. I am having trouble sleeping. I hate myself. I don't know how to ask for help. Can I really just go up to my parents and say head-on: ""I don't want to live."" I can't even imagine how they will react. Or rather, I'm afraid of their possible reaction. I can no longer get the same pleasure from drawing. I only feel pain.",

I am completely lost :( But every time I go in complete despair, someone goes to a meeting who thanks for the inspiration, for having changed something in this person's life. And in mine I cannot change anything :( find .. I have no more strength. I do not understand why such nonentities come to this world. :(",
1,"The way out is not the way out, who will blame me? I am a 40-year-old woman, there are two of my children. I have golden hands - everyone admits a good brain, but without a business vein, two higher educations, a lot of knowledge, and now - no one needs all this. And the reason is the following - I am a foreigner. Our state (UZbekistan) did not need Russians in principle, much less a Russian single mother. It fought there like a fish on ice, my mother was there. Then, when I was left with children and without hope, I went at random in clothes that I was wearing myself, with documents and children, I thought my hands and knowledge were being brought to my old homeland. But no. In Tagil, there is NOTHING for a foreigner without acquaintances (even washing the floors, a janitor or cleaning the entrances requires a red passport, and the city is small and very poor, there is no unofficial part-time job). People for 5 thousand. Wages are very necessary, they have been looking for and waiting for years, but ... Again, as soon as a green passport comes out, there is a resolute no. We cannot go to another city, the law says that we must stay here for 3 years, but for what? Unemployment benefits are not given for the same reason - a foreigner. By the way, according to the law, I have the right to employment, but bypassing the law, the FMS does not allow employing foreigners, so everyone is afraid. Seeking legality is useless, because the real reasons for refusal will be given by others. Well? Are they not needed there, because Russians, here, because foreigners? So, I do not want to sin, to commit a disgusting deed, but why be there where no one needs you? I've had enough. Mother didn't really need me. My husband really needed it until the children appeared. But he, too, did not need my children from him. Well? Children need it, but I am now at a dead end, I can’t give them anything else, and if I’m not there, the state will somehow feed them. With me now they are definitely facing death by starvation. Enough, I'm tired. My mother instructed me to live according to the principle - don't believe, don't be afraid, don't ask. First time I ask for advice. Specific. I pray every day, go to church, we believe in God, I still believe, I just broke and broke. I couldn't stand this race - I don't think he will curse me for my weakness. He is kind, unlike people. So do not recommend praying. Do not seduce a nurse, a cleaning nanny and other labors - I will go to any one, I have no pride, but there are no such vacancies for a green passport in Tagil. I can't do anything with my hands - we arrived without anything, no tools, no materials, no money. the families here do not hire workers - people live evenly and poorly, they do everything themselves. For half a year I walked the whole Tagil, I am nimble, so I know what I'm talking about. The stock exchange does not help me - they are also told not to send foreigners.",
1,"It seems that my nervous system has just gone to hell. I cry and break down on every occasion, take offense about the case and no. Perhaps this is just my paranoia, but it seems to me that I annoy absolutely all the people with whom I begin to communicate, because we communicate for a maximum of a little more than a year, and then they suddenly suddenly reduce the communication to nothing. It kills me, I am very attached to people, I can’t just take and find someone else to replace my old friend. Problems in mathematics (profile) make me feel stupid - after moving to a more ""strong"" school, my A's and B's slipped into two's, and so for six months now, I can no longer see the algebra textbook. Just starting to decide something - immediately hysterics, throwing a textbook at the wall and crying for several hours without a break. Before, I was interested in something, I was fond of something, but now I don't give a damn about anything - what will happen to my life next, how will I pass the exams, what's the difference? Suicidal thoughts returned. Perhaps this is stupid, but they began to appear at the age of eleven, when there were problems with former classmates (they beat, took personal belongings and hid them) and at home. And even then I was ashamed of thinking about it, of my excessive emotionality, because I do not want to be hysterical. How can I calm down, how can I become more interesting to people so that they don't leave me?",
1,"I never thought that I would write something like that, and I never thought that I would read articles on such sites. To begin with, my name is Alexander, in a couple of months I will turn 19 years old. In general, I feel that too many problems have accumulated. Most likely this is all due to the fact that I became a real coward and a liar, and my nerves reached the limit. So, I have a lot of debts in my bosom at the university, which I will not rake at all. It seems that this is not a problem, most likely it is. Basically, this is due to the fact that I am very afraid of people and I feel out of place every day. All the time I have to lie to my mother that I am correcting, but I simply have no strength, no appetite, no desire to sleep due to constant torment of conscience. I don't know why it started. I entered the Faculty of Law only in the first year, so that later I could enter a military university, which I could not get into the first time (I really tried), though I didn’t want to go there. Mom wanted me to become a man, this is understandable, because she was the only one to raise my younger sister and me (lately I see my father more often, but before that my mother was abandoned alone with two children). But she believes that I can become one only if I enter this military university. I do not really want to go there, but I also have no choice, since I really cannot decide myself who I will be in life. I lied too much to everyone and now I feel lousy. Before that, I felt like a really happy person and I was not afraid of people. It would be strange to hear a year ago that I would become like that, because I have a lot of experience in public speaking, and I also worked by communicating with people. I had a lot of friends, but now I just lost my arms and had a headache. I still love people and the whole world, but it seems to me that he rebelled against me. Now I feel constant terror and stress. I don’t want to train anymore, because both physically and internally I simply don’t have strength. It even seems to me that it would be better if I started smoking because of this damn stress. I'm ready to go out into the cold and just test myself for strength: if I survive, then good, and if not, then to hell. I let everyone down anyway. I constantly wrinkle my face due to the unbearable inner pain. All the time it seems that it will not get worse, but things are striving deeper and deeper. I am ready to become a lonely hermit, so as not to let anyone down. Very tired. How can I explain to my mom that I don't need a high-paying job, I just want to do what I love, although I don't even know what, I spoil everything for myself, so much so that others get it.

There, during public speeches and answers on a pair, it strongly constrained everything, then it shook. She went out into the street only accompanied by her dad or friends. She graduated from the bachelor's degree, entered the magistracy. Fell in love with a young man, and he slandered and disgraced me. I couldn't stand up for myself. In connection with this story, they began to laugh at me and terrorize me at the university. There were several times when they shouted insults at me on the street. I could not stand it, dropped out of the magistracy, ended up in the hospital, became depressed and generally stopped going out, if only accompanied by my dad, like a small child. So a year passed, I became even more afraid to go out, did nothing, during this year the level of my language (I studied at the language faculty) dropped so much that with such knowledge as I have now no one will take a job. I tried to study and restore, but the previous level of knowledge cannot be returned. The spoken language cannot be returned by sitting within four walls, communication is necessary. I will never dare to take courses or go abroad. A year later, this young man appeared in my life again, said that he regretted everything, when I said that I could not believe him and forgive him, he said that I was terrible, no one would ever love me, that this was my last chance, that he will help me change and love me. Perhaps this was really my last chance, but I could not trust and forgive him, I was also partly ashamed in front of him, even after he did this to me, that I am uneducated, that after graduating from the language faculty I do not really know the language and there are no skills to apply for a job. If I were different, perhaps he would not have done this to me and would have loved. I am very scared and ashamed to live, because I have no future. I just want to no longer be so as not to suffer. The only thing that keeps me in this life is my dad, who loves me very much and believes in me. There is also a brother who is sick and drunk and his mother is disabled and a drug addict.

After that, I didn’t deny myself anything: I started playing video games again, I didn’t get out of the Internet, and it turned out that I didn’t think about studying at all.

I have a gentle character, more likely from my mother. I do not remember more than a single time when she accused me of something or did not try to help me. I generally keep quiet about finances - all my requests and needs were fulfilled to the maximum. Unlike my father, of course. I noticed from childhood that he is greedy for money. When my mother and I went to buy things for myself, my father invested everything in the house (repairs, household appliances, etc.) It was his house and he knew that he would not fail. Which is exactly what happened. When I entered the first year of the military institute, my mother left him. He loved to drink and could be rude to her. At first I did not know, but then I realized when they started calling me one by one and asking the same questions. I realized that they do not communicate.",

So, I was born in a farm. in the family of mom and dad. lived in poverty. dad beat mom, I stood up. always told my mother when we left him. Then my mother gave birth to a brother from my father when I was seven years old. I remember the moment when he was brought home, and I ran away. studied at school perfectly. also, we have a school for 2 farms, and in another there lived a grandmother to whom I went) my mother's grandmother did not like dad, they always said how bad he was, and that I went to my father, and at any moments of my children's disobedience they reproached that I was his daughter. My mother has no education, she became pregnant with me at the age of 17 .. Anything can happen in life .. She worked as a fireman in a recreation center. I got money, I remember going to work with her, helping her. And now my mother divorces my father, my brother and I move to my grandmother in a neighboring farm, I want to go to grade 3, I study perfectly. I help my beloved grandparents. Mom in search of work travels to cities, got a job at a factory. Then my mother states that she met a man at that factory. Mom began to live with him, he lived in a farm in another area, and as preparation, my mother decided to take me to him. there people earn by growing greenhouses and so on and a trick. From morning till night I was forced to work in hot greenhouses. I helped. My stepfather had a family in the same way. was. Divorced, left a daughter. pays her child support. Lives with mom. And one night I heard strange sounds .. I didn't understand what it was .. I was scared .. We lived in the same room. and I saw them making love .. I was crying .. My mom is being used .. Wet what thoughts I had. I turned on the light and said: enough! I want to sleep. Then they brought my brother. we lived . with stepfather and mom. Mom worked at the factory with my stepfather, my brother and I were left alone, I was the mistress. And now the 5th grade is a new school, a new team. Many Turks lived in this farm. there are very few Russians) the girls were already all with forms) I am an oval complex. The boys paid them attentions, I was a gray mouse. Nobody noticed. She studied just as well. Many teachers tried to humiliate me. But I tried. There were conflicts in the family between me and my father. I remember once his daughter came to visit. we played with her. she asked her to circle .. I circled. but for some reason she was jerking all over, I asked her not to do this, but she did not listen .. In general, she fell and broke Callencourt. She ran to her beloved dad. cried. complained how bad I was. I said that she was cheating and specifically sought it .. but they did not believe me. I was a monster. I remember then his ex arrived and started talking nasty things to my mother, to me. And to my brother .. Then suddenly I wanted to return my stepfather .. In general, I saw all these conflicts .. All my classmates had a normal life with computers .. With phones .. but not with me. I reproached my mother that she hadn’t achieved anything ... And that she hadn’t learned .. I said: “why give birth if you don’t know how to provide” in general, there was some kind of offense .. envy .. My classmates already had communication with boys .. I don’t ..

I have nothing to pay with, I am still on maternity leave and I cannot arrange a child's garden, the judge refused a delay for six months. no one will borrow the sum of half a million, and the bailiffs can come at any time and take everything that is.

I took the documents and re-received. At first everything was fine, I forced myself to work, but the state was as if I had been deprived of all my energy. I did everything with difficulty, I could not remember anything, academic failures and much more. I lied to my mother that I went to university and began to skip. I understand that it is my own fault.

I only went to the psychotherapist with pills and I went tired and sleepy (I remember that I had to drink an anti-anxiety drug and some other drugs).

When I take pictures myself or look in the mirror from the front, things are not so bad. But when I see a sudden photo ... it's just a nightmare. I have a very large and long nose, and my chin is somehow bent, I look like Baba Yaga, it's just a nightmare. I so dream of making my nose smaller, it ruins my whole life. Previously, I was not so complex, but now he seems to have become more and I constantly think about how awful I look. People with this appearance are disgusting to everyone. And I don't want to convince myself that the main thing is the soul. Nobody needs your soul if you're a freak, that's for sure. I used to think that the problems with guys and friends are due to character, but now I began to reduce everything to my appearance. It seems to me that literally every girl is more beautiful than me, that I got the most terrible appearance. You will now say that everyone in this world has complexes, but I do not understand people who look great, but they whine that they are ugly. What should I do? I was completely confused, tired of fighting with myself and telling myself that everything is not so bad. I can no longer believe in my beauty. Once I was told that I looked like an actress, at first I was delighted. Sarah Jessica Parker. I just couldn't remember who it was. When I got home, I looked on the Internet. And she burst into tears because she is considered one of the most unattractive women in the world. I am completely disappointed in myself ...

1,", my name is Artyom. I am 17 years old. I have been suffering from depression for 5 years now. I tried to fight this excruciating condition. I was in a psychiatric clinic, taking antidepressants. I must say that AD eased my suffering a little. But I left them ahead of time, perhaps it shouldn't have been done. With the beginning of autumn, my condition worsened. I stopped feeling any emotion other than heartbreaking longing. I stopped seeing meaning in absolutely everything. In general, I am a musician, before it helped me a lot in the fight against depression. I lived in music. Now the music has ceased to bring me pleasure. I play songs that I used to love very much, and I feel absolutely nothing. It hurts too much to realize. I no longer want to live in this world. Nothing brings me the slightest pleasure, I'm tired of everything. Everything. I like being asleep. In sleep there is no pain, there is no problem, there is no suffering. It all comes down to the fact that I don't understand why live at all? Life is far from sugar, there is much more negativity in it than positive emotions. Why all this at all? Why endure all this life's pain. After all, we will die anyway. Only more mutilated. So why not leave now so you don't suffer? Once my grandmother said: “Why do people live in this world? I agree with her. Life is pain. Now I am thinking of asking for help again. Start going to a psychotherapist, drink blood pressure. Maybe I will feel better. There is no more strength to live like this. Why do you live in this world? Where do you see the meaning of your existence?",

1,". I am writing here out of despair. I am 19 years old, and for the last 10 years I have been depressed. I understand that for many it is wildness, but it is so. When I was 8 years old, my mother died. Since then, my life has gone headlong. Until now, I cannot move away from this event. I constantly blame myself for the fact that she was gone. My closest relatives on the maternal side influenced the fact that I was in this koryu: from childhood they told me that I had killed my mother, that if she had not given birth to me, she would have been alive, etc. My father raised me, and I still live with him. He always didn't like me especially when my mother was, he used to get drunk, threatened me. When my mother was gone, he drank, and began to recoup me: he beat me, dragged me by the hair, once even almost strangled me. But then he sort of came to his senses, gave up alcohol, asked for forgiveness, and, they say, reproaches himself to this day. And I cannot forgive. Until now, this anger, misunderstanding hurts in me. When I was little, I constantly thought that I should only die. At the age of 10, she began to harm herself, at 13-14 there were attempts at suicide. She began to study poorly, fell into a deep depression, did not leave the room for months. Then I decided to pull myself out of it. I even went to a psychiatrist, went to a psychologist. I can’t say that it became especially easier. Graduated from school, went to college. But I had to leave the institute for health reasons. The fact is that, in addition, I am constantly ill. Chronic diseases, a serious illness with legs was recently discovered. And this became a new round. Neuroses and depression worsened. Nothing works anymore, I don't want anything. There are no friends, no one. All those whom I considered friends are not around in difficult times. The young man, who also promised to be my friend, seems to have turned his back on me too. I do not know what to do. I am writing quite chaotically, for which I apologize. But there is no strength. All dreams, all hopes for a good future are ruined. Lately, I feel like I used to. More and more often thoughts of suicide come. It seems to me the only sure way out. And if before I thought that I could fix everything, that everything would still get better, formed, now it seems like a black hole. I only want one thing: to lay hands on myself, just disappear. I do not know what to do. I can't imagine how to get myself out of this. I ask for help.",

Since then, there is no desire to do anything at all. I don't want to die, but I just want to not exist. Why am I here? What would the mother suffer? I don’t want to look for a job, I don’t want to see anyone, I don’t want anything at all, but I want only one thing - just dissolve, so that there would be no me, that there would not even be memories of me.

I think it's true, why would anyone need such a burden like me “My mother is only wasting her nerves, it’s better if I don’t be there, I don’t have any problems. But there is one problem, I’m afraid to die ... I’m not afraid to leave my family, I’m scared to do it ...”",

A friend says that no matter how I behave, I should be what I am in front of them, but I don't want that at all. Now I can get angry at any little thing, absolutely anything. Lost all motivation, from studying to finding meaning in life. Over time, I began to understand that it is useless for me to live, because I will not do anything even if I study well.

I'm afraid to be openly happy about something or make plans, because on the second day something bad will happen. I am a late child, my mother gave birth to me at 42, my father was 50 years old. Dad did not want me to be born, and even our relatives were not very happy. Hence the disdainful attitude towards me, from our entire family. I was often ill, often in the hospital. My classmates did not like me and mocked me until graduation. I entered the university, friends appeared, BUT dad began to drink, he killed a man in the country, he got away from prison, they say, self-defense. Then there were suspicions that he was trying to poison us in order to stay with the apartment. For 3 years we lived on pins and needles, there was a bad state of health, but they endured because no thief was caught. When patience had run out, they told everything to my father, he silently packed his things and left. Everything seemed to start to improve, I got married, my husband moved to live with my mother. We lived together for exactly a year, during which time he completely changed, became aggressive, it came to assault. We are not divorced, but for the 4th year we have been living apart and he does not want to live together. Friends think that everything is fine with us. But we are not a couple for a long time, our relationship is friendly and no more. 3 years ago my mother had an epileptic seizure, it was very scary. After that, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor, kind of benign. We decided to leave it under supervision because it could be even more dangerous to operate. 2016 was the happiest year for me, I found a job that helped me open a business. There are chances that the ""husband"" will move back. BUT since April 2017, my mother began to have speech attacks, very frequent and scary. Doctors shrug their shoulders, I hardly work I sit at home and dijure. I'm afraid even to go to the store. This month there were none at all, I was even delighted, since my mother was prescribed treatment and was sure that it helped. But yesterday they went again, 4 times a day. The pressure was very high, even an ambulance was called. After the paramedic told me what was happening, she recalls me and said, ""Leave me, don't talk about it, don't torture my mother, how long she is given to live, the main thing is to be there,"" and everything collapsed.

1,"29 years. Man. Parents are not rich, they did not like at school. The father was drinking. Sober - a good man, drunk - a monster that I hated, but could not do anything. The father. But this is all nonsense. Childhood was good and youth too. There were and still are childhood friends, who fermented, went crazy, played grave metal (and now I play), disturbed and outraged public peace of mind. With the help of society, character has been formed in the right direction, towards respect for people and traditional values. From childhood I wanted to become a doctor. He graduated from medical college, kicked buoys while studying, changed his mind in time and finished. He worked at the NSR. It was hard because of gaps in knowledge and character (too tactful) but I got through it. I changed my place of work for the ICU department, in fact I ran away from it (it was boring to work and laziness - I am a lazy person). I decided that I had to move on and entered the medical institute on a budget, gnawing at knowledge like a damn thing. It didn't work the first time. I got a job and entered the second time. I discovered that my studies are not what I imagined. I have been studying for a year and a half. Heavy. It's boring. But if there was a dream, then there would be strength to overcome everything. And something inside me burned out. I just can not. I understand that I need to change my life, moreover, I already radically changed it for the better several years ago. Because of the woman. The woman rejected, I married another. They tortured each other and parted. So the thirty is raking in, I'm a normal guy, not a fool, I can do a lot - but I don't want to, I have no desire.

I am already sick of the fact that my every desire is fulfilled exactly the opposite. It makes me sick that no matter how hard I try, the result doesn't depend on me. It makes me sick that I can’t make up my mind to die. Last week I tried, but my mother came back earlier, I had to quickly get down and open the door. Today I tried, but could not, you see, I was scared of pain. Does this pain compare to what my existence causes me? No, but I just couldn't die. After that she sobbed in hysterics for about an hour.

I decided to do this because my boyfriend and I had sex (it didn't come to sex, because I have my own principles), but it seems he accidentally deprived me of my virginity. I felt depressed and was already thinking about opening my veins (I had already cut my arms before), but decided to consult with my mother. Although she reacted with understanding, she said that in the future we would go to a gynecologist, and if I turn out to be not a virgin, then my boyfriend, to put it mildly, is a trynder, and especially our relationship. I love him, and although our relationship is sometimes strained, he also loves me. The worst thing is that mom will tell dad about all this. He already hates me lately. I do not see my future, because my dreams will never come true. I think <method of suicide - ed. Mod.>. I cry all the time and cannot constantly be with those I love. The guy and friends live far away, and my mother is in the next room, but she is very busy (she has 3 children, including me) and I cannot hang such a load on her neck.

I talk about the problems that bother my parents, they say this to my illness, which doctors discovered in me not so long ago. But I understand that this is not the case. It just hurts me. It hurts that the closest people do not try to help me, but leave me alone with their bad thoughts. I understand that my parents have enough problems without me, but I just want them to help me overcome this disgusting condition that seizes my mind and soul. I realized long ago that I fell into a deep depression. I read books on how to overcome this condition, went to a psychologist. It got a little easier. But when something goes wrong, my mood changes immediately. My parents noticed that I often talk to myself, watch horror films alone. Mom began to be afraid of me, began to be afraid of my thoughts. Because of this, it is even harder for me: my parents think that I am perfect, I can do everything, but no. I can't just smile just like that, it takes a lot of effort. Small problems with my studies appeared, swearing between my parents - it all puts so much pressure on me that I would not mind taking my own life. Attempts were made more than once: <methods of suicide - ed. Mod.>. I often quarrel with my mother, I start to freak out when she scolds me, I do not justify my hopes or the hopes of my parents. Why should I live then? Why live, when whatever I do, everything collapses. Why live if I am a disgrace to my parents? Why do I need life if I don't know how to properly manage it? Why should I live if no one is trying to cope with depression? Sometimes I look at my parents, and they really did not deserve such an attitude towards themselves. True. My parents are always helping everyone, both relatives and neighbors and strangers. And I am so ashamed in front of them that I cannot hold back my tears.

I didn't go to social networks for several days, but my only friend didn't even call me and asked where I am. Likely when I die she will not know about it. The whole world around me presses on me and I want to scream and free myself, but I can’t, and, as a result, it breaks me even more. Nobody offended me ( They love me at school, but even this only depressing me, not encouraging me. I envy those who have a lot of strength and desire to live. I obviously do not belong to such people. I also envy those who have a real family - dad, mom, brothers, sisters. I'm alone. I'm sick of the fact that I envy others. I'm sick of who I am.

She moved because of a bad relationship with her father. I miss my mom terribly: I call 2-4 times a day, I come only 1-2 times a week (again because of my father). The guy treats me like an empty place, knowing what my mental and physical problems are (insults, humiliates, yells and hits me). Sits and plays at the computer all day and night, does not work. Now I sit and look at the printed photo of my mother and my little brother, crying in three streams. After all, only she loves me, although there is nothing to love me for. I can't go back because of my father. Plus, my only friend flew to Italy for permanent residence, and at the technical school both classmates and teachers hate me. In 2016, there was a suicide attempt, but I was pumped out to intensive care in time. Since then, the desire to live has not increased, and I only hold on because of my mom and brother.

1,". I dared to write here because there are no people to whom I could speak out and ask for advice. From the age of 6 I was subjected to severe moral pressure, and sometimes beatings from my parents. And these bullying were extremely revealing, and the brother and sister looked and laughed. Further worse, at school because of my accent, they insulted, harassed, and I often fought. Coming home, hell began again, I was accused of everything. This all had a detrimental effect on me. I began to stutter, and beat my head against the wall in my nerves, and beat themselves, the parents themselves brought to such a state, then laughed. In the 10th grade, returning from the mosque with a group of co-religionists, we were received by local Chikists. They called our parents, asked if we had any relationship, as we call it, to the forestry. That's when my mother she began to falsely accuse me right in the administration, allegedly for edification, and then she herself began to spread the rumor among neighbors that I was a Dudayev, Maskhadovite, etc. Since then I have become very closed, I stopped trusting people altogether, I jumped from 15 meters, but the department I only got bruised legs. I tried to change my life, I left the North Caucasus, I graduated from Moscow State University. I broke my family ties with these oppressive relatives. Everything seems to be fine, I work for joy, bonuses, bonuses, and outwardly everything is fine. Only from my nerves I can hear voices in head, and the head often hurts badly. Because of my difficult childhood, I do not trust people, I keep everyone at a distance, sometimes it seems that everyone who surrounds me, colleagues, neighbors, passers-by, snitches from the special services. I don't even have a girlfriend, I also suspect everyone of work on special services. No matter how I tried to forget these ridicule from childhood, such as ""what kind of accent do you have? What are you a fighter?"", or, ""Dudaev was soaked and we will soak you."" In every person I see an enemy, there is nothing to live then, no there will be no wives, no children, and we are Muslims in the Russian Federation are treated with suspicion.

My parents said that if something happened to me, they would give her away. Thoughts about death began to visit me at the age of 14. Then I learned that my own father hates me. He used to drink often. He works on shifts, that is, he works for a week, rests for a week, and now he was drinking for a whole week. When the roof began to slide down, he beat me while my mother was not at home. Once he forgot where he put his money, and later when he rushed, he could not find the money on the shelf and decided to deal with me. Thought I took the money and hid it from him. He took me by the hair and head on this shelf, resulting in a broken forehead, 15 stitches and a concussion. At the age of 14, I found out that I was an outcast for him, said that he hated me and it would have been better if I had not been born at all. Later he added that he would be glad if I died. And for 7 years I have been hearing from him every day that I am useless, that I am a creature, a pig, a brute, scum, etc. He says that it would be better if I broke my spine and died on the operating table than survived.

I don’t drink or smoke, I don’t go to night clubs, I’m not interested. There is no one to speak out. Every day I roar while hugging the dog. There were no friends left, everyone left. Mom can't get it out. I won't hear any support from her. Never felt maternal love. My parents never hugged me, they never reassured me or helped me. In 2016, my brother (cousin) died, I could only talk to him and ask for help, and I knew that he would not refuse me. He is the only one from whom I could hear support. At the age of 14 I started working as a half-time coach, at 16 I already started working under a contract, but at 18 I got a leg injury and had to say goodbye to sports. I'm confused. I do not know what to do. I feel like I'm starting to go crazy. I don’t trust anyone anymore, neither my mother, nor my brother, but my “father” even more so.

Mom gave me to be raised by my parents, lived a free life, picked up debts and left for another country. My grandfather replaced my father, and my grandmother replaced my mother. The grandfather had to sell the existing property in order to pay off the mother's debts. The racketeers came to us, those were hellish days, threats, they beat grandfather in front of our eyes .. Not childhood, Hell. But, grandmother and grandfather gave me so much love that I did not feel an orphan, they were starving, but I was fed. Then my mother started helping with money. I was 14, she returned to Russia, got married and gave birth to a child. But, relations with her did not work out. I did not feel her love. She always beat and swore even over trifles. She even offended her parents. I was 18 grandfather died of cancer. Exactly one year later, my grandmother was diagnosed with brain cancer. 2 trepanations per week. She remained completely disabled ... Six months in a wheelchair and she died. I died with her. My world was destroyed. Mother and aunt started demanding that I move out of the house. They found my father and told him to pick me up. He accepted me reluctantly. His mother made him give me an apartment. He provided but did not unsubscribe, he just allowed me to live. And reproaches every time. I got a job. But there was not enough money, I got into loans. Mother and aunt promised to sell the house and help. But, they sued me and released me. I have a good job now. But, I can't pay the loans. Not strong enough. My father is a very rich man, a millionaire. But, he told me to my face that he would not help.

Then at night I was simply drunk and robbed by strangers, who stole money, phone and laptop. In a strange city, I woke up in an incomprehensible place and then immediately ended up in the duty unit in the cell for two days. After that, I stopped using weed. But this degradation began. I cannot get out of this state. It worries me. I just realized that I was a complete moron, my self-esteem dropped dramatically, I began to hate myself. All the time I remember the past and everywhere I see my callousness and weakness. Now my lack of will has reached its peak. I don’t take care of myself, I’m too lazy to even wash. I understand that you cannot be like that, but I cannot change. I am weak and I have no will. I just want to die. I just don't understand how to live when you understand that you are irresponsible and stupid and it is unlikely that something will change.",

Undeserved grades kill me more and more every day. I really don't want to fight for my dignity and place in the social circle anymore. I broke down a long time ago. But today finished me off. Yes, killing yourself because of the grades is stupid, but when, you knew the topic perfectly and went to the rehearsal and get 2 for the test, I'm sorry, but this is too much. I am very tired of everyday bullying, of people who condemn me. I’m so much, sorry, shit went through that it already begins to choke me more and more. Quarrels with mom, misunderstandings with dad, they eat me more and more. I really can't stand it anymore. I'm really tired of the thought that I'm nothing. I'm really tired",

I tried to support my mother, I myself did not allow myself to become limp, the only person to whom I told how hard it was for me was my boyfriend. It so happened that we are in different cities, I graduate from a university, and it works. We had big plans that I would move when I finish my studies, we will live together, get married.

1,", help me with advice. I can't take it anymore. We lived with a girl for 5 years, I love her madly. We planned children and a strong family. I tried my best ... But I just have no luck ... The fact is that I have 2 higher, but after long stubborn years of searching for a career, I despaired. Let me explain, then there is no experience, then ""we will call you back"", then we found a more experienced candidate, then I simply will not pull mentally, then scammed for money. All this time I worked at work with physical activity. I tried to grow from the bottom. Yes, the bosses sufficed me for good performance for all overwork and fed me breakfast about the promotion. And when I insolently asked my boss about my status, he simply said that he just wanted me to stay in this place. Brad. At the same time, his relative comes to a leading position ... and this relative does not know anything, is constantly absent from the workplace and constantly makes mistakes. It gets ridiculous that I teach him some computer programs. At the same time, I have an average salary for the region, plus I work over the weekend. I come home tired. My beloved constantly dragged me for a walk, she missed me. I gave every penny to our young family, saved on myself, on meals and personal belongings. I hugged her every day, kissed her hands. I wanted so much to give her more, I always gave flowers. I earned her on vacation, sent her away. And I could not - I did not have vacations during this time. I tried to find another job, but it didn't work. Everything in our apartment was for a normal life. Then she became sad and uncommunicative with me. And then she moved away and said that I was not dragging. That I am a loser and I have no aspirations (I was simply taken aback) ..... that I am not a man, and I cannot bring home more money. She left .... silently left ... To a man of age who left his child. They have everything super, they are passionate love. Of course he is successful (he got a lot from his parents). Darkness, I didn’t show, but at home I cried like a child at night! It hurt so much. After a while, it became easier and I plunged into work with my head. Then my parents started having problems, they are already old and everything hurts everywhere every day .... And continuous operations and expensive medicines began, I sent them all the money I had accumulated. Then I gave way too, earning a spinal injury from overloading at work. In general, I am 27 years old, I have no friends, I don’t even have money to pull out my aching tooth, I wear a back brace. I can't work anymore ... moldy bread in the refrigerator and nothing else. Nobody needs me anymore ... you know, I went through the army in those places where it was not easy. I have never been afraid of anyone or anything. I always went forward. Now I am sitting and I do not know .. ... why, why, why? What have I done wrong in my life ... for which God is pulling me into the swamp. What am I a leper? I was sitting, preparing for suicide <ed. Mod.> And I felt scared - I imagined a fracture of my neck and this pain, my hands began to shake and tears began to flow. People, am I a fool? If I am a fool, then why is everything so ... I have not seen the sea, have not heard the laughter of my children, have not been loved by anyone.",

You need to be a ripper, you need to be an impudent, uneducated woman and then everything will work out! Maybe ... But I'm not so !!!!!!

In the fall, I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed antidepressants for me, since then I have not drunk alcohol. For 3 months now. With my psyche, everything is in order, I do not suffer from any disorders (with the exception of hallucinations and confubulation due to drinking). Now I often begin to regret missed opportunities. I missed them out of my unconsciousness, I always fly in the clouds. I am not here now. There were several attempts to commit suicide. I do not live, I exist. There is neither strength nor desire to change something in my life. I am so buried in my hole that I do not see white light, and if I do, then in black and white shades. I rarely leave the house, yesterday I went out into a blizzard, went home, it seems to have become easier, I know, I know that I myself am to blame for everything. Perhaps because of the unwillingness to take responsibility, I was brought up in this way, probably, that my parents always did everything for me. I am too soft, and due to the fact that I sit at home I am completely soft. The voice is not what it used to be, now it is quieter and more feminine than masculine. I feel disgusting.

1,"Good day, my friends. Faced with such a problem as bullying at school. This has been going on since the first grade (at the moment I'm in the ninth). In the period from sixth to seventh, I decided to change class from ""B"" to ""A"", in the hope that it would be much better there. Yes, it was, but it did not last long. Now more than half of the class mocks me. Well, to hell with them, I thought, hi themselves, they mock me. But if in 7-8 grades there was only moral humiliation, in the 9th grade physical was added. It is worth saying that in the class there are only two of my friends, or rather, not only in the class, but in general on earth. One of them is a girl who I really like since the transition to class ""A"". The second friend is the best person in my life, she always supported me, reassured me, they say, forget about them, everything will be fine. But they also mock that girl. I know many will say, they say, at this age there is no love and everything is like that. But please, if you really think that there is no love at this age, you can not help me. I need serious help. They mock that girl (hereinafter referred to as Dasha. Unfortunately, I will not write her real name for some reason). And I can't stand it. The second friend was already tired of calming me down all the time, and recently he almost abandoned me. Now with my second friend, we do not communicate very well. Yes, it was also a friend. So, they mock Dasha, but I can't stand up. Not quite the same physical composition. In other words, I am weak. More than half of the class spread rot on me, throwing lit matches at me, trying to set my hair on fire with a lighter. Yes, they have it all and I don't understand how the teachers haven't figured it out yet. And I also have stomatophobia and very bad upper teeth, and no matter how hard I try to overcome this fear, I myself cannot. I am also a beginner writer and I should assume that Dasha only communicates with me because of this, because I started doing something. With parents or teachers, I do not want to raise this topic, realizing that I will only make it worse. Parents do not inspire any confidence at all, according to my observations. But the last time has so sucked in my soul, so tired of these bullying. So callous and empty ... Desperate, I came here. Thank you in advance for your support and help.",

1,"Good afternoon. I am in despair and something inside is crying bitter tears. I came into this world to a family in which I was not expected. Father had his own family, mother lived with her mother all her life and did not build a family, but for joy she gave birth to me. It is difficult for me to judge the motives of actions, but in childhood I could take someone else's while knowing that my mother would scream, shaking like that continued at school, but already with sheets of repentance in which I had to list all my sins and lies. No personal space, all notebooks were revised, all corners were checked so that I suddenly did not hide anything. This only had the opposite effect. Initially, I studied very well, then something clicked inside and I stopped going to school. I just lay there, crying and staring at one point. I changed many schools, nowhere did I get along with the team. As a result, no basic school knowledge remained :( entered the university, somehow gathered strength and even graduated with honors. But with an even more undermined nervous system :( tried to find a good psychologist, but those that came across on the way ended up with an esoteric admixture in As a result, I despaired even more, having lost hope of recovery.At the moment I do not experience a spectrum of emotions, no attachment to people, no knowledge, no idea how to find myself in life and in the profession ... my mother is already old, my father only a year ago began to call once half a year :) and apparently both have similar emotional problems ... I don’t know how to live on: (I only see a way to leave the world because there is no benefit from me here ..",

Since I ate nothing and sobbed over the losses, I vomited blood. Now I still have anemia. And here I am in a mental hospital, disappointed parents. They did not support me. I remember half a year ago my mother hugged me when I was bad, but that's all. My parents dreamed of making a mega-candy barbie doll out of me and gave me braces. Well, of course, let it hurt me physically (the bite was normal). Now they tell me every day that I am ungrateful.

Every day a headache and misunderstanding on the part of the parents, if I say at least something about the inconvenience of braces. They all did not give up their hopes of making a person out of me, they enrolled in the hall and hired an English tutor (for the second point I am immensely grateful to them, I want to know the language) But here the hall ...

1,"This has been going on with me since early childhood. I was left completely alone, my mother died when I was 2 years old, and my father married another and does not even visit. When meeting as a stranger he treats. All other relatives died. Grandparents remained. Even from school I was beaten by classmates, my aunt, my grandmother kicked me out of the house, the teacher punished me for theft. Nobody believed in me when I spoke the truth. I thought about dying since high school because I found out that because of me my mother was gone. I blamed myself, tormented myself, wished for death. Gradually, I began to lose the meaning of everything. I grew and received even more blows: betrayal from a friend, bullying, humiliation and rejection from classmates, shame from my cousin and terrible rumors about me, my best friend died from a heart defect ... At that moment my wound grew even more, it was unbearably painful ... Gradually moved away from everyone, lost its meaning, got seriously ill, the smile also disappeared. Every night I despised myself, sobbed that I exist, that I am a failure, etc. I graduated from high school and entered a doctor. There the same story repeated itself. They would not humiliate me and inflict the same blows again. Due to illness, I began to lose my appetite and soon completely stopped eating normally, I also could not study, I was constantly at a loss and I forgot everything, the teachers also began to treat me with contempt. Everyone in the group just rejected me and I was left alone. I do not know what to do? I don't feel any sense in anything, I hated myself, I can't even eat anything and sleep at night, stress, nerves, tears and pain, suicidal feelings, fatigue. This has been going on for 15 years. Help me please. I don't know what to do anymore?",

Now I am still experiencing another betrayal in my life ... my beloved man left me, on February 14, humiliated me, raised his hand again, ran away and even took all the money and took it for himself, he, who was everything to me .. did everything for him. She accepted a beggar from another city, helped to get a job alone, where they paid more, he used to work as a security guard for 15 thousand, minus alimony for two children ... Then I helped him and sent him to work even better, in Russian Railways, as an assistant driver .. We lived with me, he has no housing. And now, when the salary became large and the alimony ended ... he didn't need me, he decided in his head to leave me as soon as he saw how much he received the first time without alimony and with the increase in salary, he did not immediately let go of his card. His attitude towards me has completely changed recently, he was indifferent to me before, he never regretted, neither in grief, nor in illness, it was just 2.5 years for him that I was like a servant or something, to cook, wash, etc. , he left me more than once, as soon as he began to express discontent with him, ran away from me ... I always returned him myself, humiliated myself, and he was on dating sites and so on, he always looked for others immediately during such partings and took the money, he also always blamed me for everything, he did not admit his guilt in front of me ... But now he reached the edge ... raised his hand, because I told him that he was treating me badly, I started hysterical, first at his indifference, then at the insult, I couldn’t stand it, scratched his face, when I began to humiliate him completely .. he didn’t like it yet .. but before he was lying, so ... So he raised his hands and then ... now he denies everything This is .. afraid that I will take off the beatings .. that they say I beat him with 100 kg of a man, half his size, but he was only defending himself ... horror ... the thing is that he simply did not need me, when the money appeared, there is nothing to take from me, 40 years old, sick, childless, he will find healthy and young with money, it is only a beggar, he was not needed by anyone ... this life is not sweet, I cry all day, all shakes with nerves, my heart and blood pressure, everything hurts, I can’t sleep or eat ... nothing helps to forget, no pills, no other ways ... Advise, can anyone there was such a situation ... Loneliness is a terrible thing .. to live without children, without friends, without communication, etc., and such a betrayal of a loved one just finished me off .. How can I survive ???",

I do not understand why I exist, there is no benefit from me, the fact that life itself is happiness is delirium. She graduated from a bachelor's degree, worked both during her studies and after, sometimes by profession, then no, money is tight in the family, I live with one mother, since childhood I had to refuse in many ways, could not just be a carefree little girl, and now even more so an adult , I have to do a lot around the house and only have to clean, otherwise we just live in mud, etc., it's a shame that I can't always look good like other girls, although I'm pretty, it's difficult to combine work and study, I try very hard, from this I’m tired or sick all the time, I don’t have a common language with my mother, but if I don’t speak at all and I don’t answer, I’ll hurt, but it’s difficult to communicate, only criticism and talk about my bad future, that nothing will come of me, like her it didn't work out about the appearance either, I can't hug and there is no desire, there is no young man, those who were kind and not good enough were possible for someone. Dad left early, we communicate little, I don’t know how M and F communicate, hardly anyone will appear. There are almost no friends, she herself lost everyone, she loaded them with her chatter too, I'm glad that one friend recently appeared, but I can't whine and tell her what worries, I'm afraid we will also stop communicating then.

There was no particular love, but the man seemed good. He was from another country. We left for him. Humiliation, insults began, when she was pregnant every day, humiliated and mocked. There was a miscarriage. She did not leave him because of her son. My son went to school here, he cannot write in Russian. Without a husband we will be immediately expelled from the country. My husband beat me up just like that, he was drunk. Then I asked for forgiveness, I forgave. All this has been going on for almost three years. I no longer believe that I will ever have a normal family. Resigned to his bullying. Two weeks ago he began to kick us out of the house. Yesterday I saw on his computer that he was on a dating site. The child does not want to go back to Russia, but we cannot stay here. Life is crumbling, there is no hope for a happy family. I live only because it's scary to imagine how my son will react to my departure. It will be a terrible shock for him. And I am so drawn (...). I can't imagine how to live at all. Family was my biggest dream in life. I really wanted more children, and now there will be no more of them. And there is no happiness. I'm all alone here. No friends, no relatives.

1,"I don't even know what to do here. All my school life (9 years) they laughed at me in class, and I often had to move, and it so happened that I changed several schools. Only one was more or less good, but I was there for only a week, and then I switched to another. She never approached other guys and did not start a conversation, simply because she did not see much sense in it. But I always had one school friend who asked about my everyday life, and with whom I could take a walk. But all these girlfriends disappeared as soon as they moved. Now, in another city, I have been living for a year, and I have already left two schools, but already voluntarily and because of outright hostility from my peers. When I was a teenager, they started to mock me because I didn't like the local fashion. Well, you know, gates, supreme, thrasher, what is called ""hype gear"". In my first school in a new city, I tried to be kind to my classmates, but they immediately started gossiping about how old-fashioned I was dressing. In the second, my love for Japanese culture, in particular, anime, was already ridiculed. And also the natural burriness and the fact that I am quiet. Even one parallel class laughed at me, they could block the way and laugh. There were ridicule during the lessons, but the teachers, even the one who was also a psychologist, just didn't care. I am only friends with my childhood friend and cousin, but they live in another city. I am afraid of people, afraid to talk to neighbors, afraid of everyone, even small children. It seems that everyone condemns me internally, as my peers have always condemned, so I avoid communication. I have friends on the internet, but that doesn't make me happier. However, I have a boyfriend (three years older), and we want to meet in the summer. We've known each other for a year, and I feel comfortable with him. Although at the beginning of the relationship I was tormented by the fear of being abandoned. Well, like, who in general would like someone like me, especially a high school student? But he always supports me, it's some kind of miracle.",
1,"Good evening. I am writing here for the first time, I really, really hope for your help and support. Like everyone here, I have no one to tell about my problems. I really hope for your understanding. Let's move on to the problem. Very much I love one guy with whom I met for a month. For me, this was the very first relationship. Everything was great, I would even say very much. But then one fine day, we were together and he brought me home a little later than my time, I was punished. A very unpleasant situation happened before this day. I posted a photo of my press. In the photo there was nothing at all provocative or something else, well, an ordinary photo of sports girls being photographed. On that day, we did not have a very nice conversation with him and, let's say, he decided to piss me off. Because after that incident, he ignored me and I asked that this was his final decision about our relationship, he said yes. Then I started talking to him in tears, the reason is not clear to me and he said that he wanted to check whether he could make me angry, because before that I told him that it was impossible and that was all. After that day, I never saw him again. We did not communicate with him for 2 weeks, I wrote and called, and he constantly said that he had business. And then 2 days before my birthday, he said that he was not ready for a relationship and decided to wait, I asked if I should wait for anything at all, he said that he thinks Yes, that's all. After that, there was no contact at all. He stopped liking photos, Well, in general, he stopped doing everything. But you see, I can’t wait any longer, I love him to madness. And in order to drown all this pain, resentment and try not to think about it, it only helps to cut your hands, put some kind of chemical burns, to be honest, I think about suicide. Because the resentment is stronger than me. You see, I just can't live without him. And I can't communicate with other boys either, because I love him, I only trust him. After all, it was he who taught me for the first time, in my 17 years, to kiss, he taught me how to truly love. I can't be with anyone else. I can't kiss anyone, because I am faithful to him. Help, I'm just in a hopeless situation. I thought maybe he told me so on purpose, because after that situation with photography, I gave myself 4 chemical burns. He swore heavily and I warned him that if he does something to me, he will never see me again. Then he asked in what sense I was. I said I would commit suicide <ed. Mod.> 2 times I already tried to commit suicide. <methods of suicide - ed. mod.>. So it won't be a problem for me. Maybe he was just afraid that I would really do it and that's why he said so. Maybe he got another one. You see, I would have nothing against, but just with all his behavior and what he did, he showed that he loved me and felt it herself. He also said that he did not need anyone except me, he did not look at others at all. You see, I felt that he was faithful to me. And after such a situation, I don't know what to think at all. Please help me, please.",

We met for about 2 weeks, this is very little, but I became very attached to this person, we can say that I fell in love and now it is very hard without him, every day obsessive thoughts about him, memories, everything that happened to him and I just can't get rid of this endless mental anguish. He said that it was his first time that he really fell in love with me, his friends also told me about it. He often called, wrote, invited to his place. We celebrated the New Year together, and after the chiming clock, he took me to another room from everyone and said something that no one else had ever told me before. He said that he loves, that he wants this year to be ours, so that I support him and he me, I was happy. But after a few days, everything changed, he stopped answering, writing, calling, and began to ignore. The last time I came to him, he was angry and displeased, but he said that everything was fine when I asked what happened. After I left, we did not see each other again, I called, but he did not answer the phone. And a few days later I was told that his feelings had cooled down, but he did not dare to say this, it’s easier to score and not explain anything. A few days later, I found out that while we were dating, he cheated on me with another girl who knew about our relationship. A month has passed since our last meeting and communication, and all this month I have been scrolling all this in my head every day, I just can't forget, I resorted to alcohol a couple of times and it became easier for me, although it is clear that this is not an option. I can't get it out of my head. Despite the fact that he is guilty, uttered beautiful false words, betrayed, abandoned, I would be ready to give him a second chance and would like to return, provided that he apologizes, changes, there will be no more lies and betrayals and everything will be fine. But I know that he forgot about me long ago and maybe he already has another one. More often than usual, thoughts began to creep into my head that if I die, then all the torment will end, and to be honest, it doesn't scare me anymore, I really don't want to live, because I understand that nothing else awaits me in the future, despite my young age, I have never had real friends, a loved one, he was the first and, it seems to me, the last. I don’t know how to live on, I can’t bring myself to do anything, to start changing something, I just don’t know where to go, I can’t find a place for myself and I constantly want to cry, but I hold on. I just hope that someone will help with advice, it will already become easier for me",
1,"In life, I have always been good-natured, sincere and soft-hearted, when they asked me to help, I did what I could - and I almost never refused. But my good is rarely returned to me like a boomerang. When I ask for something, in response I usually get cold ignorance and indifference. Every day, people are killing me more and more sincerity and kindness, which I try so hard to give them.

1,"You know, I'm 31 years old, a healthy handsome man. There was a civil marriage, lived a couple of years with my wife, then she got pregnant, agreed to have an abortion with tantrums, and so on. She went and said that we were parting, a month later she called and said that she wanted to see her, I certainly didn’t refuse. And so she said at the meeting that she had not done an abortion and loved me at that time I was 23 years old. We began to live with her, of course not a devil of scandals, but I loved for sure, and now there is a turning point after the scandal, she closes the apartment and does not let her see her daughter for half a year. She calls the police, hides somewhere, in the end I decide to commit suicide. And I am sitting on the balcony railing. I look how not to crash someone else's car, I light a cigarette, I didn't care about this life, even if I die now or will work at the same level. A Tatar girl miraculously came out to me, she took my hand and called me to drink tea and fell in love I began to meet with her and life surprisingly began to improve, two months passed and my common-law wife called me, gave my daughter a phone and thank God my wife was not there, I would have torn her up. Another month passed, she asked to return in tears, and I made a huge mistake, I returned and left Guzel. A year later, the situation repeats and I did not touch her for a month, after this month, she is getting married, I go into hysterics until I was 29, I could not work for more than a week , to think and do something useful, but just tried to see my daughter. Then somehow, with the help of religion, I got out and met Anna, we met her for a year and she got pregnant, made a condition or I obey her or she has an abortion, after three months hell begins I woke up and heard fucked up from her and came and heard fuck you went to bed she told me you fuck here no one needs the door open you no one keeps it like this lasted almost three months and I could not resist left, now my son is 1 year 4 months old when I meet him, I hear scandals and scandals. Every day I think about suicide, but my mother is still alive, and if I do, I’m afraid for her, I dream of a quick death, I saw my second wife now meeting with a young man. And I can’t even have sex. Alimony and the first and second I pay to live literally I have nothing to pay for the loan for her car and the alimony is still taking 50% off, but until next year. The work is not happy, my relatives are looking after but will not understand, I can’t do anything, the car I was smashed into the trash in an accident, my teeth are crumbling, sex with women does not work out and under alcohol it is not pleasant (although there is a lot of female attention, I can’t leave, I just don’t have anything to do). I’ve already resigned myself with all this. I just want to die, there is no meaning in life , I'm not young, I can't find a wife anymore, I'm afraid to have children, films are not interesting books do not come into my head. I do my work and business through strength. Mom swears at me every day, but I was so tired of everything that when I saw one thing, I quietly quit the job that I did, I drove by work many times forgetting about it and thinking about suicide. I really want to die, but quietly and painlessly, so that my mother would not die. I know that my loved ones will be very happy about this.

1,". I am 24 years old, I have a daughter, she is 4 months old. I'll start from the very beginning. I worked as a nurse, lived with my own sister and her family, everything was fine. I was only 21 then. On weekends I went out with my friends, there were a couple of credits, but I paid for them on time. With credit money I took myself a laptop and a fur coat. She spent the remaining money on herself. Then somehow I met a guy and started talking. We liked each other and started dating. But I have always been a freedom-loving girl, I loved spending time with my friends. Because of this, quarrels began. He didn't really work, he was constantly messing around and running after me. I parted with him, but he almost ran after me on his knees, threatened with suicide if I left him. And so we met for a year. Then I myself did not notice how I fell in love with him. And our second year was wonderful. Then I got pregnant. We decided to live together, did not sign. We took the car on credit. And then the horror began. He raised his hands to me, conducted himself boorishly, eternal quarrels. I paid the loan, he always has some kind of problems. Then I got a stomach, he stopped hitting me, but the quarrels continued. Then my decree, childbirth. All this time I was paying the loan, going into debt, collecting the bag in the hospital. Now my daughter is 4 months old. I am all in debt, I took loans online (the penalty is growing daily, the percentage is terrible). I borrowed because there was simply nothing to eat. I also breastfeed. I cannot take the child to an appointment with a neurologist and an ultrasound scan (because it is paid and there is no winter clothes for the baby). There is no one else to borrow from. He beats me almost every day. My mother refused to accept us, my sister is now divorcing her husband. I have nowhere to go. I don’t know how to give a loan. I would like to commit suicide <ed. Mod.> That's all. Every day I curse myself that I could not get away from this goat. What should I do? Sorry for the child",

He graduated from the institute, served, went to the civil service to learn how to communicate with people of different levels, thinking and direction. I worked and decided to go into my own business (woodworking and packaging production). I got busy! There was not a lot of capital for what he was aiming at, but I really wanted to realize it for a number of several reasons (both the market is free, and the connections are established, and the contracts were in hand) had to attract my relative and other third-party investments! Diligate duties, started! The project was good-looking and had a place to live, and how! At the same time, at the same time, the same ""relative"" invites me to do a mahogany tree from Africa (send some equipment and start an activity). They say he has his own person there who is in the subject (Russian). I read, counted, analyzed (the direction seems to be the same), bought the equipment, sent it! Upon the arrival of the container with all this business to the place, I set off on an ""amazing, long and unknown path. An adventurer, apparently! Or an idiot! Probably the second! .... In general, I arrived and I begin to understand that something is not right here either!"" The money that I sent for licenses and the forest went to the fund for the development of poor and poor Africans! Yes, while I take my friend with me so that he would stay here for the elder!

1,"! Last year of suicidal thoughts every day. I'm all sick, falling apart, my head hurts, my heart, my stomach, I can't sleep anymore. Doctors do not find anything ... they shrug their shoulders, and I am literally disabled. A month ago, a friend of mine committed suicide due to health problems. I roar all the days. I have a child, the child's father does not recognize him, he intimidates that if I do a paternity test, he will harm us. And I am so sick and broken I can’t really work, forever, either I’m on sick leave or on my own they ask me to write who needs sick workers. In general, hands down. I'm afraid to do something with myself. Even now, I am writing this letter and roaring, my head hurts, everything is spinning, nauseous, heartbeat 115, my stomach twists and so every day. At the hospital, the doctors said, if you go, we'll put you in a psychiatric hospital, you have nothing. If I go to a psychiatric hospital, then there is no one to leave the child with. I don’t know what to do. I'm on the edge ...",

She even tried to commit suicide 2 times. With the second at the age of 20, and I met with him for 5 years. By the way, in my nation, sex before marriage is despised. And the second young man accepted it with pain, but accepted it, loved it. But for 5 years he frayed my nerves, was a womanizer, did not cheat, but often talked with others behind my back. roared, forgave. humiliation was in the form of frequent obscenities and insults in my direction. I endured everything. it was hard to breathe without him, with every breath a pain in the chest. They swore, put up. But now, he is tired of it, that I do not forget his shoals, but at the same time I deceived, I found out, presented it, he did not like it. As soon as they stopped communicating, I immediately began to communicate with others. hurting me. 2 weeks did not write, broke with the ends, leads a different life, and we were going to get married, and suddenly now he thought that suddenly someone finds out that he did not take me as a girl, it would be a shame. HOW TO 4 YEARS WHEN HE SLEEP WITH ME? I am disgraced. Okay, 2 guys. But now wait for her husband, who will be 3rd? and it's not a fact that there will be a husband. I already have dreams as if I have many men and I wake up in sweat. It hurts me from the betrayal, that he spoke words about love and left me, but I still love and worry. I don't want to live again. At the age of 16, I tried to leave this life, and now I am again overwhelmed. I’m such a naive fool, I don’t see the point in life ... Yes, I’m to blame myself, I know, but there’s just no telling why it all happened this way. I'm just tired of crying. Every day I fall asleep and wake up with tears. I don't leave under the covers.

She always calls her diminutive, and she calls me mum. What should I do?",

All they ask of me is to study (although in fact this is not all), but I cannot study, I am not a social person, there is only cattle in the class. Today I was sitting, listening to depressive music and broke through to tears, my mother and grandfather came up and started to scoff, take pictures, etc. I freaked out and went into another room, the kitchen. I sit further, not bothering anyone, and then they again, I broke off and threw a butcher board at the door, and broke it (a glass door), and then the ""mother"" takes my headphones that friends from another country gave me, and they cost about 70.000.

Loans, debts and a broken arm, I can't work yet. The daughter turned away and said it was her own fault. I do not deny it. You are the one to blame. The deafening loneliness I probably deserve. It's strange that I always helped everyone, but in the end, when I needed help, no one was around. There is only mortal fatigue. And the feeling of their own worthlessness. And the price of my life seems to be not so high, only there is nobody but emptiness. I'm scared, I'm very scared. But, I see no other way out.",
1,"I really need to talk. I can't talk to anyone, no one will hear my pain. I grew up in a terrible family. My mother and father were terrible. Mother Nature did not reward her with intelligence, and my father, from my age of five, went into binges with constant frequency. There were all sleepless nights and scandals, and escapes in one blouse across half of the city to relatives in the middle of the night. I have never felt love and care. I kept myself all that time, I don’t know what. But the fact that my psyche was broken from childhood is a fact. I've been through a lot of nasty things. She brought herself to anarexia that turned into bulimia. And then, in the circle of bad company (but then it seemed to me that they were good people and friends), ""weed"" came into my life. And I went into the world of unreality and dreams. It got to the point that it became an everyday necessity. I got up in the morning, smoked a joint and went to work. Mother and father divorced and we moved to a two-room apartment. She was constantly on a spree, people changed in our apartment and they were all drinking companions. Mother began to drink too much, justifying this by the severity of the divorce. And I didn't care being in the world of illusions. Suddenly, I found out that I was pregnant. who was the father as he found out about it immediately disappeared. But another appeared and decided that he wanted to be my husband and the father of my child. As I learned that I would become a mother, I stopped smoking altogether. We signed, a daughter was born. We lived with my mother. But since the fights continued, and my husband and mother are constantly on this basis, we went to his family. But even there we were not welcome. Disassembly scandals and a total lack of money. The husband turned out to be not as holy as he showed himself at first. And in the seven years that we lived, he raised his hand to me several times. We lived in rented apartments for several years. For the last two years I have wanted to divorce and leave. I don’t know how, but he held me back all the time. And when I was completely winged, I agreed to a psychologist. He diagnosed me with depressive neurosis and put me on pills. For a year I held on to them, under the pills life seemed much better, I was cheerful and cheerful. Gradually, I got off them and realized that it only got worse. She filed for divorce and moved back to her mother. Escaped from one hell and went back to another. The mother has been living with her partner for the fifth year. And there is not a day when they do not drink. Sleepless nights and drunken scandals go on endlessly. My head, which had already gone, is now even worse. At first I was scared by the thought of the future, but now it didn't matter. Obsessive thoughts of suicide appeared. I cry every day. There was no strength left to live at all. I am crying not for myself but for my daughter. The child lives in terrible conditions. I don't want to leave her without her mother, but I think that she will be better in the orphanage. Than with a mother who can't give anything.",
1,"I already wrote here, but today it got really bad, I saw my ex-girlfriend with her new boyfriend in the telegram. The problem is that a year has passed since our parting and the blame was completely on me, I told her such things, out of my stupidity, I got angry and then our relationship collapsed, bad things told her that enemies would not tell each other. I work as an English teacher, I have all students of different ages, and they are all good kind people. I think they are better than me because I myself am a very evil person and have already wished a lot of evil to my ex and her boyfriend, and I wished a lot of things to my enemies. I want to die, I can't watch another kiss and hug her now. Only my parents and these students of mine stop me. And those who created this site have a very kind heart, and everyone who helps here are also good people, I respect you, it is very important not to leave a person in trouble. You are doing the right thing, you always need to help people, I think any person deserves help.

1,"Я впала в глубокую депрессию. Ни один день не проходит без истерики и мыслей о суициде. 10 месяцев назад я даже и представить не могла, что в моей жизни все настолько изменится. У меня было для жизни все, мне всегда помогали родители, иногда родственники, я никогда не в чем себе не отказывала. Все было замечательно до поры до времени. 13 марта я встретила молодого человека, который обещал мне что прокленет меня до конца жизни, и я буду страдать до конца своих дней, если не буду рядом с ним. Я конечно же не придала этому значения в то время, и зря. Мы были знакомы всего неделю, он выслеживал меня уже давно и все хотел познакомится. Я дала понять изначально, что не хочу с ним быть и это впринцепи невозможно. Он начал преследовать и караулить меня под окнами, постоянно угрожать. Эту ситуацию я решила через своего отца, в короткие сроки, с этим молодым человеком серьёзно поговорили, больше такого не было. Но после этой ситуации, спустя примерно недели две, моя жизнь начала рушиться. У моего отца на работе разбился сотрудник на машине,пьяный, на смерть. Дело дошло до увольнения, но эту ситуацию слава богу замяли, но потом поймали другого сотрудника с наркотиками, за распространение. Конечно же эта была подстава, потому что мой отец перешёл дорогу одному влиятельному человеку, они не поделили деньги и это все началось. Сейчас до сих пор идут бесконечные суды, которые мы пытаемся выиграть, но ничего не выходит. Отец сидит уже 10 месяцев то в отпуске, то на больничном, потому что никакого выхода нет. На руках у родителей маленький ребёнок, 2-ух годовалый, который тоже требует огромного ухода и содержания. Отец попал в аварию, которую тоже подстроили, у него сейчас огромные проблемы со здоровьем. Нужно содержать семью, платить мое обучение, выплачивать долги. Я просто не грани, учусь в меде, учеба очень сложная, пришлось выйти на работу, потому что выхода никакого не было. Хронический недосып, постоянные штрафы за опоздания, еле еле свожу концы с концами. Родители перестали помогать вообще, учёбу я тоже теперь оплачиваю сама. Зарплата просто смех, из-за отсутствия опыта. Мне хочется рыдать. Пишу это все со слезами на глазах. Вот уже не за горами 1 февраля, очередная оплата, платить конечно же нечем, ещё плюс висят родительские долги около 5 млн. Требуют конечно же с меня, потому что больше не с кого. Ситуация с его работой не решается, папа пенсионного возраста, это первое, надежды выиграть суд нет никакой. Я постоянно недоедаю, очень Рада что на работе есть бесплатная еда, этим и спасаюсь. Так бы уже давно умерла с голоду. Пытаюсь искать какие-то варианты заработка, но все почему то против меня, все рушится в последний момент и не складывается. Мне хочется умереть. Отношения с противоположным полом даже и не клеятся, у меня никого нет и никогда не было. Я не могу себе никого найти и думаю что др конца жизни так и буду одна. Пытаюсь ходить на свидания, но после второго/третьего все заканчивается. На давит все, долги эта учеба, которая отнимает все силы, пришлось продать любимую машину из-за долгов. Каждый день просто на грани, стою на балконе каждый день и думаю чтобы спрыгнуть вниз. Счастья просто нет, никакого. Пол года сидела на антидепрессантах, постоянно превышала дозу и мешала с алкоголем от отчаяния. Мысли о суициде не покидают меня. Я все ближе и ближе к этому шагу. Мое здоровье конечно же пошатнулось. Я на гране отчисления с Универа, нет никаких сил и желаний бороться. Поддержки со стороны родитеоей абсолютно никакой, они на меня просто забили. Всю жизнь была сильной, со стержнем и стальным характером. Сейчас просто опустила руки. И стала как размазня.  Мне хочется кричать от отчаяния. Я так больше уже не могу. Очень устала от такой жизни.",

I was a loved one, but he only wanted money and buzz from me, my best friend betrayed me, I live in my father's house like a slave, I sleep at 4 o'clock and wake up at 6. I have no one to share my grief. My own father demands money from me for living, does not give me writing, says buy food for yourself I do not yet, but such a life. wanted to die, but this is not an option.

1,"I am a first-year student, I live in a hostel, I have not got along well with my neighbors. In general, I rarely meet with anyone and from this I feel terrible loneliness. I can't live in a hostel. There is an excessive lack of personal space, necessary as air. Constantly tormented by a feeling of guilt for the past and fear for the future. Sometimes it comes to thoughts of suicide, but more often I think about my worthlessness, uselessness, I catch myself thinking that I can not achieve anything, even just improve relationships with people. Due to the incessant state of procrastination for 2 years now, I begin to hate myself even more. All this left the joy of life, lost all the remaining friends. Just desperate. Tired of living in constant stress. How to bring joy back to life? How can I start to please people close to me, instead of not noticing them or not complicating their life?",
1,"I can't live. I hate myself. No prospects. Negative thinking. Tired of everything. The last hope was faith, religion, but it did not save me either. I already took antidepressants, there is no money for it, and they did not help, they only turned me into a vegetable. Help is nowhere to be found. I constantly think about death. I can neither live nor work. Thinking about where to get money for a gold injection. There is no one to tell this. Crying constantly, constant depression. Apathy, I don't want to do anything. I want to die, but I'm scared. Only this stops. Just so tired of living and suffering. I hate my psyche. I wish I hadn't been born. I cannot change anything. I tried everything. Now they just dropped their hands. I myself can neither support myself, nor calm down. I'm tired of suffering and torturing others. Sit on someone's neck. I believe, but I can only pray to die. I can't fight. I can't adapt. People like me should die in the wild, it would be better if it happened. I hate myself and my personality, I'm sick of myself and my past, present and future, even though I don't know anything about it. I want to be different: joyful, calm, sweet, friendly, positive. But I can not. I listened to all sorts of lectures on psychology, but it doesn't help. Nothing helps. I don’t have the money to go to a psychiatrist and I don’t have money for medicines either. I cannot work normally, because I am constantly depressed and anxious, but there is no way to recover. I dream of dying permanently. I want to say this: I am sincerely happy for those who are happy and contented with life, who can enjoy it. May God grant such people even more happiness and joy, and more love! And to those like me, may God send consolation and salvation. So I sympathize with such people, because I understand that they cannot change anything, I understand it by my own example. All the problems are in the head, and I sincerely feel sorry for those whose brains are shaped in about the same way as mine. I don't blame my parents and everyone else who hurt me. They themselves are sick, like me, which means there is no point in being angry ... I want to die, I really want to. I'm not angry, but it hurts a lot. And no one cares about this ... I understand that I do not deserve that someone cares, but it hurts no less ... Every day, month and year, I get worse and worse. I want to shout out, but there is no one to tell.

I have no friends and a loved one, I always fall in love unrequitedly. I'm studying to be a nurse. But soon I will most likely be expelled due to the fact that I will not pass chemistry. I hate my body, my face, my hair, even the shape of my nails. I also have HPV (human papillomavirus). I am worried that this may develop into cancer. There used to be another proctological disease, or rather, it still exists. I am not cured, because very ashamed to go to the doctor. Now I’m not ashamed. And now I have as many as two proctological diseases that urgently need to be cured. But this requires money and, I think, a lot. I'm not going to tell my parents, I can't get a job, because I am at school from nine in the morning to five in the evening. Recently, I have been seriously thinking about suicide. All my problems haunt me. Serious health problems, self-loathing, academic problems, debt, unrequited feelings, lack of support. I don't even have anyone to talk to about it.

Just walking down the street is a huge challenge. Every time I see girls walking down the street, I try to hide my face, if someone made a laugh, I think they are laughing at me. All because I hate myself. I'm a freak, a disgusting face speaks for itself. I envy handsome rich men. families who have everything, but I have nothing, not a single plus. Nobody needs it .. The parents hate me. After several years of beating me in the face with a boot, my father decided to dump me. Mother tells me straight to my face that I am a mistake of her youth that he wants my death and confirms his words with deeds. She tried many times to strangle me with her own hands, once threw a knife at me, what a pity that he hit the handle on my chest. And I can't move anywhere from it, I I'm just afraid to even talk to people, they are all not one head better than me in everything, I can't do that. Love, I hate her, I confessed my feelings three times, and it's better not to even remember what happened next. I just- simply unworthy of love, I have no right to be loved. I really want to get rid of emotions and feelings, because I know that if I fall in love with someone, then only two options are possible: It will not be mutual, and I will feel bad, or they will play with me for a month or two, and then they will leave me, and it will be even worse for me. is not needed, it is like a bone in the throat, it terribly interferes, just like myself.

First, on the demo version (not real money), it seemed like it worked, I got real money from a credit card and raised 90,000 on the very first day, I was very happy and cheered up. And a few days later I lowered my entire credit card for 500,000, I was horrified, because my wife will give birth to a child in a week, and she and her son are also on me, as well as alimony for my daughter from my first marriage ..... I didn't know what to do. ... I took out a loan for 5 years to pay off the debt on the card and brought money back to the trading site to recoup .... and .... I lost again .... Now I have a debt of just over 1 million rubles .. .. The wife does not know anything and I do not tell her, since she will give birth in a week. I do not know what to do. Thoughts only about suicide, but children and old mother are holding back .... I don’t know what to do.

There was a case when they gave me a job, but then they took it away and gave it to another person and said that I was to blame for everything, that I sent it by mail to another organization and that there were mistakes, although I did not have time to finish that work as it was taken away!

And he must fight for his life himself, without anyone's help, and must rely only on himself but it takes away from me there is too much strength and nerves to fight.

1,"My husband left me a week before giving birth. She gave birth to her third child in November. The child is not entirely healthy. Treatment required. I don't have time to deal with older children. Everything in the house began to crumble. The electricity stopped working, the heating was turned off. And, as evil, it's winter outside. I live on my penny, I hardly have enough for food. I'm going crazy with this contrast. After all, until recently my older children were happy, well dressed, and studied in various studios and circles. And now we sit and freeze in a crumbling house. The husband laughs, says that he did not quit. ""If I want - I will come."" At the same time, it has practically not appeared for two months. I will file for divorce, for alimony, but I still can't understand how this happened? What to do? I want to die, but I can't because of the children. I have nowhere to attach them. How to survive? At least hold out until spring? It will be easier further. Probably. And it’s also sickening to realize that it’s my fault. I myself drove myself into this situation. Why did I trust my husband? Why did you hope for him? He was glad to have the third child, and I understood that if something happened I would not be able to stretch the children myself. And this is what happened. I do not like myself. For ruining everything, for the ruined childhood of my children, for giving birth to a baby with a problem. How to deal with this alone? How to survive?",

A disabled mother was on me, she lay for a year, I was on my side, now she can hardly go to the toilet, and thanks for that. A young daughter on a disability, her whole soul ached for her. I work alone, my husband is not my friend, but a picky rival. I tolerate. I smile. Everyone considers me happy, because I am silent about everything that happens in my life. God always helps me and I love Him. Confession and communion are my support. Optimist. I read you. I answer you. Now I just want to hear from you.",

He's 22 years old (I'm 19) but he thinks like an adult, a serious person, without a wind in his head. ... For him, the main thing in life is family and we made so many plans for the future. He was my first and he really appreciated it. But the other day he saw a photo taken a year ago (before meeting him !!!) where I was hugging my friend and after that I was very angry. In the end, he said that he understands that it was all a year ago, but he cannot forget it all and that we had better remain friends. And he said that there was no one better than me and that he loved me. Would a lover give up? For him, the modesty and decency of the girl is above all. Now I probably don't look like that in his eyes. We corresponded for 1 day as friends. He said that when he returned (he left for another city to his parents) he wants to meet with me, I agreed. We have not been in touch for 3 days now. Going crazy . I don't even consider other men for relationships. For me, he was the best. Faithful, well-mannered, loving and caring I feel that this is my person, we are alike in everything. Always complemented each other. ... I know that he comes to my VK page, but does not write. I'm tired of all this. I love him madly. If I find out that he has found someone, I will die of a broken heart. How can I be in this situation? Writing and trying to get it back won't help. I will only look pathetic in his eyes. But I can’t sit idly by. My Soul Hurts .(((",
1,". My name is Alena. I am 17 years old. I study in the 11th grade, so, in fact, this year is not an easy one for me, and the situation in my family is making everything worse. About a month ago, my father left the family. He left to live with another woman. My father had already cheated on my mom when I was 11 years old. I have a younger brother who at that time was only two years old, so my parents did not divorce and continued to live together. After some time, I don't know how, but my mother was able to forgive him. Of course, she did it with great difficulty. And unfortunately, like almost any person who experienced such severe emotional stress, the mother began to periodically pour alcohol into her grief. But it is not enough for her to just drink a little wine and relax, she cannot control herself and if she drinks, she gets drunk until she drops, while becoming a completely different person. Everything changes in her: Her voice, manner of speech and behavior. She often pretends to only drink a bottle of beer, but ends up getting very drunk. He hides a bottle of something stronger in his room, and later, on the sly, can drain it to the bottom. It always made me very upset, but over time she stopped doing this, as soon as the situation with my father was resolved and they healed as if nothing had happened. We traveled a lot together, with the whole family, and I hoped that finally everything was fine, like all normal people. But it was not there. Recently my father left, and I was very shocked because I was completely unaware of it. Now I do not understand at all what is happening with my life. The mother started drinking again. He says that this is the period, and that it will pass. But I can't hold back tears every time I see her. She's either very very drunk or just sleeping out. Behaves selfishly. She knows that I'm under terrible stress right now, but that doesn't stop her. As it turned out recently (surprise surprise), my father has been dating that woman for three years. For three whole years he has been lying and cheating. I am incredibly sorry for my mother, but I cannot live like this either. I can't watch her ruin herself. I have had tantrums very often lately, because she is the most precious thing I have. I can no longer look at myself in the mirror, I just can’t pull myself together and start thinking about studying, because this year I have to pass exams and go to college. I haven't been to school for two weeks now. I can’t just get myself out of bed. At first it seemed to me that my mother and I could cope, but now I understand that neither she nor I can cope. I don’t know what to do. I'm thinking about taking my own life. It's just that my life finally loses its meaning and I cannot find it in something new. It feels like I can't do anything else. I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have much friends either. Now I practically do not communicate with my dad and I cannot trust him with my feelings. The last time I spoke to him about a painful problem, he said that these were the words of my mother, not mine. Supposedly I have no opinion of my own. I am a strong person by nature, I understand that everything can be survived. But now I really feel like I'm not doing it. Thank you very much if you read it.",

It is very difficult to be far from family and relatives, and to this there is stress at work (I work as a waiter). I'm 23. It seems like I work with adults, but somehow they behave like a child. How can they substitute and for the smallest detail or question they begin to attack. I understand that I am slowly losing my mind. Today I drank 4 tablets to calm me down. Today, suicide is spinning in my head all day. I consider myself unnecessary. Maybe I was born by mistake after all?",
1,"I'm dumb and lazy. Actually, on this topic, I came across this site. I'll tell you everything about order. Now I am 15 years old. I only really taught my lessons until 6th grade. Starting from 6, all studies came to zero. My father ruffled his nerves, hiding gadgets from me, putting a password on my PC, trying to shake the knowledge out of me in the evening after work and at night. What did I do? My parents are divorced, so I lived with my father, I come home from school - he is at work, and it starts ... I crawl around the apartment, find a hidden Smartphone, bypass the password on the PC and play the fool. In the evening, when my father demanded to answer the lessons, I made cribs (Lord, cribs to answer my own father). And with a sin in half told. After the 9th grade (currently) I entered the engineering cadet corps by pull, because my father's brother is in a high position. And even here, it would seem, I have to hold on, I had a chance to break into people, but no. I'm messing around here too. I'm worthless. I have a bad memory. Weak will. Pretty bad temper. I don't even have a girlfriend, if only because I'm incredibly stupid and don't know what to talk to her about even in VK, not like in real life. And so, my father's heart could not stand it (he had a stroke in 2010, and now, when I entered, he ran every two weeks to me, the devil knows how far, his heart was wearing out even more), he died on 11/28/2017. I got the last motivation to do something. I would like to say that my father was an officer, and did not die lying on the bed, but on the way to work, to which he devoted 36 years of his life. I do not see my future, or rather I see myself in it in the role of some sort of janitor. The worst thing is that I realize that I am rolling down, picking up speed exponentially, but I can not help my laziness and apathy. And I've always been that way. The death of the pope only intensified this. Call me what you want. A fool, an idiot, a worthless subhuman, all possible curses, I agree with everything in advance. Because it's all for me, it's all true. The saying ""only the coffin will correct the hunchback"" about me in full. I have no thoughts of suicide, just as I have no will for it. I'll just either get drunk or become a janitor in some small town. My uncle is able to move me somewhere, but there is no point in it. Morons like me are not needed anywhere, they will kick me out at the first opportunity. I do not know what to do. I would be glad to any comment, be it a description, what a moron I am, be it support, or advice.",
1,". My problem is that a girl dumped me after a long relationship. I am terribly oppressed by loneliness, everything around has turned gray, the people around are the same, self-esteem is completely destroyed. I have no friends, since I closed myself in this relationship. I can't even convey what I feel. The fault lies with me, but I have not committed anything criminal. Day after day I think about how to get out of life, I try, but in the end I give up. It lasts about 3 months, the days are like torture. How to live on if you know that the person is yours, but he will never be with you again? This is my first time and I can't figure out why it hurts so much? Objectively, everything was terrible. At some point, I myself wanted everything to end. But isn't it human to be wrong? Why can't I understand that a person doesn't care about me and he doesn't want to see me, or hear or know? My imagination draws all sorts of events associated with her, but this is one pain. More like a cry from the heart. It seems to me that I can’t bear it and will die. I cannot imagine that there will be someone else besides me and that the person does not give a damn about me to such an extent that he recognizes everything that was a mistake. And these thoughts lead to the line. It’s impossible not to think about it. Emotions gave out in full - emptiness eats away and everything is new, day after day. I can’t let go and I don’t see life without a person. I'm trying to kill myself. I don't know what else to write. After all, it's better to leave now, so as not to see everything later, isn't it?

1,"My name is Asya, I am 26 years old. It all started when I couldn't find a job for a long time. It literally killed me, though not, it almost morally killed me. I cried every day, thoughts of committing suicide literally swarmed in my head. I turned to a neurologist for help, I was prescribed tranquilizers. It seemed to be easier for a while, but there was a feeling that I was completely empty. There was only a small anxiety left. I began to take barbiturates to calm down a little. When I finally found a job, it didn't make me happy. After working a little, I learned that there will be a reorganization. I felt scared that I had just found a job and was about to lose it. I began to calm myself down again with barbiturates. I didn't even realize that I was already in an inadequate state. Later I started drinking. I drank cognac almost every day, for about 3 weeks. Then thoughts began to appear again about how to retire to another world. I started using more barbiturates. At first there was even euphoria, and then I just wanted to go into oblivion. I knew that the lethal dose was not far away, and continued to take. As a result, she completely lost her mind. And what I was afraid of happened. I lost my job. Although I was even forgiven for what I used, if only I got out of it. But after I was dripped with glucose with saline, literally 2 days later, I had an epileptic seizure right at work, and many identified it. It has come to write on my own.

To say that it was hard for me to get used to it is to say nothing, but I somehow overcame it.

She showed herself from a bad, daring side. She made friends there with a girl named Masha, but here this year she did not go to the eighth grade with me (she moved). And then everything was listed. Constant depression. But why was it only at school, at home, I was cheerful. Parents began to pester with grades, there were no friends. For this eighth grade I raised one ""Nobody needs you!"" To pay attention to you, you must approach them !!!! They pretend to be such good friends, but in fact leave you when they get bored ... My thoughts have changed, I used to look through rose-colored glasses and now ... Bad thoughts began to come. At the very beginning, after school I had a real hysteria !!! I came home locked in the bathroom, turned on the water and cried !!! And no one cares about you ... They say that I am arrogant, bad character. I really like to rule, be impudent and mischievous (I honestly don't know why). I struggled with this ... But no one cares at all early ... One day a friend with a SMILE said to me, ""Yes, you all use it !!!"" and smiled. And I laughed, although I wanted to cry, run away ... Yesterday, when I was walking, I went to the bridge ...

Then it seemed to me that I was just some kind of unnecessary thing for parents. No, it’s not that they didn’t notice me, they always bought me what I wanted, loved, pitied, in general, everything was like in a good, prosperous family. But since the age of 14, a nightmare has simply been going on. At home, there are eternal quarrels and often these are cases when my mother comes home from work, her nerves will be raised there and she breaks down on me. Shouts, humiliates. Morally, I am a weak person, I understand this, because with every bad word I say, I take it close to my heart, I can sit at night, think about it, cry. At the age of 14, problems began at school. I have always had good grades and even now. But it's about the teacher; I've never met a person like her. She is very insulting to children and goes to the subtleties of the person. For example, there was a situation with my classmate, when the teacher in front of the whole class said, ""This girl has an empty refrigerator, they don't feed her, she probably has no money at all."" And that girl's parents plow, work, but pay little money. She insults everyone and starts to hurt me. Every time from her lesson, I could leave in tears. Also, at the age of 14, first love. I met a boy, we talked very well, everything was fine, but then he did a bad thing. He threw me on public display. And now I understand that I do not want to return home, I do not want to come to school, I understand that there are not even friends who will support me.

There are hobbies that arose most likely on the basis of loneliness. For a year now I have been learning to write electronic music (in the genre of uplifting trance and big room house), in general I love music, and I want to buy myself a midi keyboard or synthesizer, I worked as a DJ in a club for a couple of months and even there I could not find a girlfriend, I read books , I began to visit the gym because of this it became even worse (because there is no special sense in a month), I like to take pictures, I write poetry. It seems like I can joke, I behave normally with girls, I don’t be rude or swear, there are demeanors. I tried to meet online, and even went on dates twice, but to no avail. On the street, at best, they simply ignore, at worst, they send.

I have extremely low self-esteem, self-doubt and constant anxiety, I tried to keep a diary, perform various exercises aimed at relieving emotional stress, and so on. the result is zero, or rather with a ""minus"" sign, because the failures made it worse, even got a cat for myself. I consider trainings to be fierce nonsense, because the methods of coercion into actions are fraught with even more stress. I also started smoking, at first it calmed me down, but now it's just a bad habit that helps pass the time.

I graduated well from the university, two honors degrees. But I am not a confident person, I am afraid of everything, I get worried at interviews and everything fails! For half a year I have not been busy with anything! I started drinking when I was 15, and I liked this state! Today I can drink a bottle of vodka alone! I can drink three, four days a week, it comes to the point that I just fall! My husband works on business trips, I think he also has no idea that I have binges. Then I wake up eating and sleeping all day! All around is a mess, everything is in bottles, there is a stench at home ... I cry and swear, on my knees, I swear that I won't be anymore ... And then everything seems to be forgotten and I think, well, why not have a drink. I can let everyone down if I'm out of drinking, don't go on business. My grandmother is ill, she is after a stroke, I go to visit her. I can even exchange her for a hangover, call and lie that I’m sick, but in fact I’m just sick! Some kind of vicious circle, I want to disappear, maybe I don't need to live? Maybe you need to be treated? But it's so embarrassing ... In front of family, husband! Although my husband can drink too, sometimes he hits me, I'm so used to it that I don't even take offense! I think that this is a punishment for me for being like this ... Forgive me, Lord God",

1,"About 3 years ago, I fell head over heels in love with a girl who is a year older than me. We met by chance on the street, I immediately approached and met her. After a while he called her for a walk. Everything went just fine. I was very much in love with her, and she herself began to understand this and sometimes respond with disgust. Later I found out that she has a boyfriend whom she has been dating for about 2 years. I decided not to communicate with her anymore, because I did not want to spoil someone's relationship. I was in great pain, and I could not forget her. After a couple of months, they broke up (I learned this from her friend). I decided to call and find out how she is. We renewed our communication. We constantly walked with her, held on to the handle, sat on the bench. We were happy together. I was incredibly happy about this, but after a couple of days she writes to me that she does not want anything serious with me. This answer finished me off completely. For a year and a half I have not been able to forget her. I see her almost every day on the street, and my heart bleeds from just seeing her. Now I can’t look at other girls, I’m just thinking about her all day. I’ve never fallen in love so much. I don't know what to do now ... It makes no sense for me to get up in the morning. life has lost its meaning, everything has lost its meaning ...",

He considers me a dishwasher and a cleaner, so if something is wrong in the house, then he starts yelling furiously. And he doesn't care what's on my nose for the exam. I don't even care about this exam anymore, my dream of finally leaving my abuser father will probably never come true, since the family has problems with money. My mother committed suicide long ago.

I have no friends, everyone has long betrayed me and I have been walking alone for years. I have health problems and insomnia: I sleep for 4 hours.

1,"10 years. My starting point. I was a cheerful, versatile child. Gymnastics, knitting, reading, skiing, everything is interesting, everything is new. When I turned 11, my dad started a mistress, began to constantly break down at us, my mother cried constantly. And my happy memories are over. His relationship with a married neighbor lasted for about 2 years. I hated going home, hated when they raised my voice and began to hate myself. She fell ill with psoriasis, gained 40 kg in a year, stopped going to school and completely immersed herself in books, especially those written in the first person. A neighbor, learning about his wife's tricks, beat my father and took his family out of the city. The parents have not divorced. Almost 30 years have passed, and I have not been able to forgive either my father for his hatred, or my mother, for her helplessness, her tears and requests to talk to my father so that he does not leave the family. I tried many times to commit suicide at 11, 12, about 14 years old. The last time was 12 years ago. Even at the age of 11, I gave myself the instruction that I would not live to be 40, so I did not build a career, I just existed. I have no friends, I haven’t even tried to create relationships with men, there are no pets. In an attempt to find the meaning of my existence, to deal with my troubles, I turned to a psychologist. 4 sessions. I realized that I did not see myself here and now, and I don’t know how to fit myself into real life. At first I felt some relief, but after the last session I started to have a strong hysteria and I could not bring myself to continue the treatment. For me there is only black and white, I cannot let go of the past, I see no way out, but I try to fight. She began to study in. language, start and throw felting, amigurumi. Last year I got my license. And I understand that thoughts of suicide are returning more and more often. If my body is so tenacious, then the option of buying an inexpensive car, driving out of town and crashing into a rock seems more and more attractive. A fat woman with a bunch of chronic ailments, unable to maintain social relations. So far, he keeps only that by killing myself I will kill my parents.

1," everyone reading this !!! I looked through many different stories in this group in search of answers to my problem, but I never found it. So I decided to write my own story and get your opinion. I'll start with a little background. Since childhood, my parents considered me to be very smart, almost a genius and would like me to become at least a successful person with decent earnings, and so on. I studied well, it was rather easy for me than I liked it. And when it came to dealing with difficult subjects or tasks (whatever) that were not given to me, my parents were literally angry, upset, and for me their reaction to such things was quite scary. I tried to avoid this (in early childhood, even because of 2 fours, I cried as if someone had died), but the further into the forest, the more firewood. And so I finished school, wrote an excellent exam. My father sent me to a military school (I left it because it was not mine for sure, I made a decision), with grief across the floor I got into a construction university. Studying was difficult, each failure met with rare criticism and every time I was less and less willing to talk about it to my parents. And here I am in my second year at this university, I completely failed the session and retake. It was hard for the parents to tell about this, and they themselves found out later. I took an academic, the crush on me was high and in order not to let my father down, for the most part I agreed to study here further. I study again and was expelled again. And again I do not dare to tell my parents, only this time they will not be told about it. My name is Vladimir and I'm 20. Now my psyche is on the edge and I don't know what to do. How to tell? How to overcome fear? Etc. Why am I afraid? I was kicked out of the house for many ordinary offenses, and this time I am afraid forever. Now I live on the street, you can say. My parents think I'm in a dorm. In Moscow, there are few places where you can live economically, so I live anywhere. A good friend helps sometimes, but it's all for fun. Mostly on the street at train stations. Communication is difficult, so I hope you at least read this. Yes, I'm 20 and it's hard for me to deal with my fear, I hope no one will experience what I am experiencing. I want to end it all, but in a different way. I want to die",
1,"Oddly enough, I've been thinking about suicide for 5 years (now I'm 16). There are many reasons for this. It all started from deep childhood ... My favorite person, my grandmother, died. It was a huge loss for me. After her, her uncle also left (many sad memories are associated with him, such as: drunken brawl, beatings and the like). And, to my great surprise, my family, including me, was blamed for their death. Almost all of my father's relatives came to see us. After this incident, we moved from the village to the village, and, it would seem, life is getting better, But as they say, in every barrel of honey there is a fly in the ointment ... From my uncle my dad caught the tuberculosis virus, and no matter how much I begged them, they did not quit smoking and do not want to be treated. No tears, no pleas, no hysteria helped. Every year we go to the phthisiatrician, no summer camps and mountains of pills. But then I thought: ""But why? After all, I want to live."" I was terribly afraid of mantu, X-ray and medical examination. By the way, my parents are disabled, my father is of the 2nd group, and my mother is 3rd, so they are unemployed and we live only on my mother's pension and my part-time job (on vacation). My parents often drank with my mother's relatives and neighbors, it happened that I spent the night on the street in the winter and did not eat at all ... and last year I gathered the rest of my strength and moved to the village to live with my aunt. In that school, they immediately disliked me, humiliated me in every possible way and said that a slut would grow out of me, a girl of easy virtue and all that sort of thing, although I studied diligently, helped around the house. I could hardly endure until the end of my family year and decided to transfer back to the village to my parents ... As a result, I am scum for them, an ungrateful hysteric and no one for them, my brother who loved me more than anyone else was told that I had died. One summer my brother beat me just because I said I wanted to go home ... He tried to strangle me, but he stopped, and now I think, why didn't he? Then I walked all summer in pants and a sweater with long sleeves and a neckline so that no one would see bruises.",
1,"I've always been different from other people. I remember that the problems began in kindergarten, because I was there always away from the children, and rarely talked to someone. Then there was a school and an institute, but everything there only worsened even more, because people not only refused to accept me, but in addition to this they began to mock and mock me. And because of all this, my psyche was in a deplorable state by the age of 20. I believe that I was born with some deviations in this regard, but the school, institute and all kinds of other social groups finally finished me off. In the end, I never graduated from the institute, and began to try to earn money, but also, to no avail. As for my parents and friends, thank God I have and have them, but in my life, unfortunately, they are not able to change anything. I also had a relationship, I don't know by what miracle even this all happened. True, I did not meet the girl for long, she left after realizing that she had no normal future with me. And so, as a result, now I'm 22 years old, I don't have a job (and I don't see an opportunity to get a job), relationships, friends have all been building their lives for a long time, and I rarely see them. I am a very nice guy, but in life it almost does not help me in any way, since everything in it depends 80% on your communication skills. Girls make eyes everywhere, but as soon as it comes to a conversation, they immediately scatter. I am absolutely not adapted to this life, and I do not know how to fix it, and whether it is possible at all. I just began to feel sick of people, I can't see them, I can't imagine myself trying to strike up a conversation with someone again. But at the same time, I understand that I cannot sit at home all my life, around my parents' necks. In general, I get a kind of hopelessness in the end, and I don't even know what to do, every day is the same, and there is no hope for a brighter future.",

Above me was a leader in my city and a more senior leader in Moscow. I had a good relationship with the Moscow chef. After some time, this leader left the company and another was put in his place. He made it clear to me that he did not want to see me anymore, and that after NG I had to leave. My local leader began to communicate with me in an extremely arrogant and hostile manner.

1,"Good afternoon! I am writing because there is no one to talk to. I'm 38. I have a little daughter. She's 4 years old. Nearly. There was a relationship with her father, but he left us forever when her daughter was 4 months old. I stayed with my parents. During these 4 years, my relations with my parents have deteriorated. They began to literally hate me. The daughter did not adapt well to the kindergarten. Plus, not all vaccinations are with us and need to be completed, due to the fairly frequent ARVI and the lack of vaccines, I do not live in Russia, I cannot go to work. We live on the help of our parents and on unemployment benefits. The worst thing was that I had a hard time going through the betrayal of the child's father, we met for many years. And she fell into a severe depression. Parents are also depressed. They have a business and are at work all the time, but things are going very badly. Sitting with a child is a shock for me, no one wants to. For my mother and my father it is an unbearable burden to play with her, read a fairy tale, put the cubes, draw. Mom sits with the child only when there is no other way out - I urgently need to go to an employment center or a polyclinic. The father began to drink more and more often and generally said that I could not count on him, he would never sit with his granddaughter. They give money for food and medicine if needed, but emotionally they are completely detached. They are annoyed by my appeal to them. They think that I don't want to work and have hung the child on them, poisoned their pension. All these conversations lead to an even more difficult emotional state. They speak to me in a raised voice, without respect, often with contempt. Often they say nasty things in front of my daughter that I am a parasite, for example, who has not worked a single day. Although this is not the case. I have almost no friends and no one who could sit with a child. There are almost no savings either. There is not even an opportunity to go to a psychiatrist to prescribe some antidepressants. I stopped playing with the child. I cry often. I just don't have the strength for anything. I want someone to regret and just hug. I do not associate my future life with men. Very often betrayed. Sometimes it seems to me that another family, childless, with positive parents, would give more to the child than I did. I love my daughter very much, but I feel mentally ill. I cry almost every day. It's hard to read, watch films. I stopped reading for a long time, and sometimes watch their episodes on TV. But this is not the worst thing. I just do childcare work every day. And that's all. The child became hysterical. I spoil her. Often I buy her whatever she wants with my last money, but that's not enough. Play is not strength, desire. I want to constantly hide somewhere in my world. I don’t know which way out. I only feel needed by a child and nobody else needs us.",

I am full, very complete, there is no way to find a job from here. If you take some kind of physical labor, then already at 10 minutes I feel bad, my head is spinning and my heart beats incredibly.

1,", I often have thoughts of suicide, but something prevents me from doing it. After 6 years of relationship, a girl left me. But it all started much earlier. I began to withdraw, I have 1-2 friends and lost interest in anything at all, including life. It got to the point that you sit and look at the ceiling, in front of you or somewhere else. I stopped doing anything. Everything turned out so that I myself went to this and did everything for this myself. As a result, the move, under the threat of expulsion, money problems and the first person with whom I spent 6 years of my life leaves me. When I realized all this, I realized that I was left alone, not counting my relatives. All sorts of thoughts began to creep into my head, I suffered, felt and still feel emptiness and see no reason to exist in any way and do anything for this. I lost my appetite and began to smoke and drink too much coffee, I sleep a couple of hours every two days and I’m scared to go to bed and wake up. At first I tried to get out of my comfort zone: I talked a little with strangers, I just started walking, I met a couple of old friends, I found a part-time job. But in the end, thoughts about a person who have cooled down towards me still creep into my head. The relationship was bad, I didn't do anything for them. However, having lost a man, I realized that no one would be better than him, if anyone at all would be. And I can't get 6 years out of my head. I read information on such a banal topic, and parents repeatedly say that time heals, you won't be cute, you yourself came to this, etc. but I cannot imagine life without this person. At his age, it got to the point that he tried to cut himself, tried to swallow pills, but this did not lead to anything fatal. I pushed the person even further, now he became indifferent to me and completely ignores me. I understand myself that it is more like a cry for help. But now I am trying to decide to leave this life, but it turns out that neither there nor here. And I can’t live like that, it’s too empty and lonely, and I don’t dare to die, because I don’t know why. And all this has been going on for the second month. You seem to read and understand that people's situations are much worse, but this is somehow far from you. You come to an empty apartment and everything starts to shake, you want to run away, you want it to be the same as before, only better. What we have we do not keep, having lost we cry. As a result, complete isolation. I wanted all this, did everything for this, but realized that I was mistaken. No hobbies, no interests, no meaning. And I can't live like this anymore. The city has become a stranger. People are gray. Before that I did physical exercises and read books, sat at the computer. Now I just can't develop. And I think this way: either rot, going into games, alcohol and something else; or suicide, which I think about for the second month and try to make another attempt. This is my story.",

На этом все и закончилось. Потом как то необходимость в браке отпалб.Отношения в итоге сошли на ноль,начал гулять ,узнала что изменяет.Было очень больно. Оказывается он мне изменял не первый год,а я даже не догадывалась.Расставание перенесла очень тяжело. Очень похудела. Много пила,ловила себя на мысли что спиваюсь. Поддержали близкие . Еще будучи с ним влезла в кредит,вечер не хватало денег. Потихоньку начала приходить в чувства. Поменяла работу ,вроде все становилось на свои места. Но отношений не было. Были какие то мимолетные, но ничего серьзного . Так прошло два года. Через сайт знакомств познакомилась с парнем . Понравился ,он первый кто за два года хоть как то зацепил мою душу. Но не так все просто.... Работаю в банке ,имею некоторый доступ к данным клиентов. Пробила его ,оказался женат ...ребенок ,точнее два ребенка.... Я даже не могу передать свой шок...на тот момент за мной ухаживал еще один молодой человек,хороший,обеспеченный ,но меня песпощадно тянули к тому у которого двое детей. Спустя время тот который женат все таки сознался ... оказалось жена в Китае на зароботках ,мол не может с ней развестись пока ,но обязательно разведется ,признался в любви ...я знала что это не правильно ,быть с женаты...но тянуло  к нему,с ним было так хорошо что я забыла про первого....начали официально встречаться. Познакомил з друзьями ,начал говорить о совместном проживании,но мол пока нет денег что б снять квартиру ,сам он жил с детьми и мамой ,мама помешала с детьми. Я настолько влюбилась что готова была принять этих детей. Но не долго счастье длилось. Жена вернулась ,начался дурдом,она узнала обо мне ,и начала делать все что б его вернуть...это был кошмар,звонила ,угрожал,проклинала меня ,вечно пыталась то фото мне прислать там где он голый и т.д что б показать что он еще с ней. Она забрала детей,мы начали жить у его друга тот уехал на три месяца и отдал нам ключи. И тут я начала понимать что мой милый очень много врет,он остался без работы,работала Толь ко я ,денег не хватало ,опять долги и кредиты.  Работу он нашел. Работал в клубе  ,я радовалась как дитя,начал нормально зарабатывать,но тут мы узнаем что друг ,который дал квартиру ,умирает...погиб в АТО , ШОК....с квартиры съехали ...на ренту квартиры денег не хватало,переехали к моим родителям . Он начал пить много на работе ,сами понимаете клуб... Стал пропадать,его жена так и терорила меня,он все ей спускал с рук...постоянные ссоры ,мог пропасть на сутки и больше... Сижу как то на работе,звонок , ответила...сказали что мой Паша валяется в каком то баре ,точнее под баром пьяный,я срываюсь с работы еду на другой конец города что б забрать его ,а его нет...забрала жена...она там Просто рядом жила.Ступор.плачу.ИСТЕРИКА. В итоге оказалось что его избили . Черепномозговая травма. В больнице была с ним она. Там и встретились. Кинулись бить меня,оттащили ее. Он при мне ей сказал что будет со мной.я думала что все наладится...что он не будет так больше пить . Но нет . Он продолжил . Какой то период вроде нормально было,но на долго его не хватило.

Не хочу жить...устала, он,кредиты,проблемы на работе. Просто не хочу жить. Сегодня первый раз подумала что хочу умереть. Но второго разрыва я не переживу. Я морально иссякла. Нет никаких сил жить.

My mother is good, and my father, but they are both very strict. I was taught from childhood to say only ""yes"" and never contradict. Mom made me rewrite the entire notebook if she saw at least one blot in a word. So she lived in fear. But at school I met a girl. She also turned out to be my distant relative. I drew a soul in her. Loved like a sister. But I noticed that when I was in love with one boy, she stopped being honest with me. She began to criticize me often. And then she betrayed. Very much. She started various rumors about me among relatives. This was the first terrible disappointment. But I forgave her. And by the way, about that boy. He said that I was fat for him, and we had a fight. I was so disappointed in him that I was sick for a month. My temperature went up dumbly, my whole body was trembling. At the end of grade 11, 2 months before the exam, my friend betrayed me again, and I tried to kill myself, but my sister was there and saved. I didn’t live up to my mom’s hopes, didn’t get the highest marks on exams, I couldn’t go to university, but I went to college. I thought that I would meet true friends, my love.

She doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, that's okay. She just has no hell of nerves, she breaks down on me, screams over trifles. She says that it’s because of me that her nerves are shaking, although I’m silent in a rag, and never go into conflict. I do everything around the house, but if I don’t do at least one thing, then all. Shouts, obscenities, that I do not do anything, although this is not so. She always fights with her grandparents. I will not say that I am an angel too, because no one is perfect, but I feel sorry for my mother, I do not want to swear with her, but she herself begins to provoke a conflict. I study so myself. There is no strength or desire to learn anything because of the situation in the family. She recently told me that she didn't want to talk to me anymore, as if I didn't support her and didn't love her. Now she hinted to me that she does not love me, and we will have a purely business relationship, that she feeds me, dresses me, and that's all. Everything that is due to a mother, and no more. No love. Despite the fact that I am still a child, so to speak, I myself already have to hell with nerves, headaches every day, and so on. I'm tired and can't live like this anymore. I understand perfectly well that if I end my life, I will make my family worse, because they will be even worse, grandmother and grandfather will not survive, but I am tired of all this. My biggest fear in the world is death. It's true. I am very afraid of dying, but I don’t want to live either. I do not know what to do. I love my mother, and my grandmother, and my grandfather, and I love everyone, and I want us all to live together, but this is no longer possible. Mom said that I can go to my grandmother and live with her, or stay with her, but she won't talk to me about anything at all. Of course, there were some joyful moments in our family. I even thought that my family is the best and happiest. But no matter how it is. I don’t want to leave my mother, but I don’t want to live without saying a word to each other either. Right now, my soul hurts a lot, I'm all lost. There are a lot of things I would like to write, but there are so many thoughts in my head ..

I entered a university after school in another city, but my relations with people here did not develop as I would like. The problem of inability to find a topic for conversation made itself felt, and so every day for two months. I began to think more and more about the life left in my city, about my mother, about the health of my loved ones and about the fact that they are not eternal, that I want to be near them. Thoughts of loneliness and numerous fears (I chose the wrong profession, my mother is not getting younger, but I am not around, the life of all my classmates is developing, but I do not) made me cry almost every day and eventually pushed me to the idea of ​​leaving school and enrolling in next year in your city. But upon arriving home, I fell into a terrible state that continues to this day. I don't know why get up in the morning. I began to realize that thoughts had gone out of my head, I don't know what to talk about even with those with whom there were previously topics for conversation. Even with relatives the same problem. Conversations in the family are based on my inquiries, and I myself am not able to discuss something, I don’t even know how to formulate it. I speak only to the point, in all other moments I am silent and it would be fine only with strangers. I seemed to have forgotten how to communicate. I don't know how to joke. And what I am telling comes out dry and crumpled, I feel as if my ability to think in general is leaving, I cannot formulate thoughts, I forget the words.

Who needs a silent man? And then what is the point of everything? If you are alone? This is a dead end, because now I need to prepare for admission, and in this state I not just cannot force myself, I cannot remember anything ... I am afraid that I simply will not pull the university, loneliness, misunderstanding on the part of people, including and parents who are sure that I can easily prepare for admission myself, but I don't even know where to go and why.

1,"Hi, I never thought that I would be included on such a site. Always, until this year, I treated life with a positive. This year I went to a new school and it so happened that I did not really make friends with anyone. Some classmates they smoke, drink, swear, but in fact they are not bad guys in communication. I did not find common interests with them and therefore did not make friends. There are other people, but communication with them has come to naught. In the new team I felt like nothingness .All classmates take part in olympiads, go somewhere and they are SUCCESSFUL. No matter how much I tried to try myself, it was unsuccessful. From this year I began to develop a fear of the stage. I want to perform in the theater, but I can't because of it. It really hurts me to feel like no one, I have a mediocre mind, and I'm also very ugly! Yes, this also plays an important role. Guys never pay attention to someone like me. It hurts me to tears when I like someone, but he also chooses another, which is prettier or more accessible. No matter how I tried, I cannot myself edit.

Since childhood, I have dreamed of such a profession and this topic is especially important for me. My family supported me, but did not pin their hopes. And so it happened that I failed in two cities at once. When I returned, I had to submit documents to the pedagogical, which I just do not like with all my heart. But my mother put pressure on me and now I regret that I followed the lead. At first it was even interesting. New atmosphere, people, objects. But then I began to understand that it was not mine. I am not interested in doing assignments, listening to lectures, and this is definitely not something with which I would like to connect my life. Depression began, it was difficult for me to come to school. Each time I stepped over myself, stepped on my own throat. Everything seemed meaningless and gray. I've lost all my cheerfulness. I began to cry too often and hardly smile. I became absolutely indifferent to everything that was happening around. After numerous hysterics and reflections, I decided to pick up the documents. The dean's office told me that by leaving here I would never achieve anything. But the statement was still accepted and told to wait for the order. Parents found out everything on the same day. Dad didn't mind, but with mom it was much worse. She called me names in every possible way, humiliated me, threatened to kick me out of the house. Throwing all the things at me, talking about what a terrible daughter they raised. I spent the whole night hysterical, and in the morning my mother went to pick up the application.",

Only friends, good acquaintances. Almost in all collectives they mocked me or treated me like some strange creature. Also, in 23 years of my worthless life, I have never had a relationship with a girl. I'm just afraid to meet them in real life. And acquaintances on the Internet do not give anything: they see perfectly well how boring and boring I am, too soft, modest and just stop communicating with me. As a result, they themselves realize that I have no friends. And when they find out that I have not had a relationship until now, they say that this is not normal.

I grew up as a very downtrodden child. I often hear my classmates rushing home, I hear them talking about their parents, but I never wanted to go home, I feel good at home only when I'm at home alone. Often when I come home from school, my stepfather sits in the kitchen, because of this, I do not eat until he leaves there. I do not know what this is connected with. Stepfather, He is very unbalanced, constantly throws himself and his mood changes as if on schedule: a scandal occurs, he is calm for a week, in the next three days he begins to get bored, get bored, dig into everything and then again a scandal. On my mother and on my 3-year-old brother, he rarely breaks down, of course his favorite scapegoat is me. And recently he cheated on my mom after 13 years of relationship. They filed for divorce. Mom suffers, loves him, suffers. And I do not understand how you can love this <expletive removed - mod.>. He never did anything good to her. All he does is <rude language removed - mod.

I understood this perfectly, I understood that she was in shock and that she needed to throw out her emotions somewhere. But today he came again. They were sitting in the kitchen talking. I overheard their conversation. My stepfather said that he could not bear the fact that I didn’t make my bed in the morning (I take my brother to the garden and I don’t have time) and that he was leaving because of me, because all the quarrels were because of me. Mom replied that she hates me, that she wants me to leave, that she doesn't care how I will live. She spoke so calmly, her voice did not even tremble.

1," everyone, I'll start with the fact that in a month I will be 24 years old and I feel that I wasted a lot of opportunities in my life, in short, I fucked it up. From childhood he was a notorious, strange type who could not normally be in society. From primary school I was an excellent student, but in the 8th grade I stupidly scored on my studies and finished school with one grade four a year. I entered the budget, I graduated, I work part-time and I don't see any sense in my life. Terribly became a lazy person, although it is difficult to call me a person, it still needs to be earned. The face from the 8th grade has become covered with acne and still does not pass. Because of this, there are strong complexes, the point is not even that this is aesthetics, I just experience discomfort, pain in the face area and the feeling that I am dirty all the time. Those people who were sick know what I'm talking about, it's when it's impossible to touch your face with your hands, as it hurts a lot. He was treated medically with vitamins of group A retinoids, but without a counter. As they understood, there was no relationship with the girls, I have been masturbating for 10 years, tried to quit, lasted 7 months, now I lost it again. I thought that acne was due to this, now I am trying to do sports, jogging, maybe this will help. I am completely devastated, I listen to the sermons of priests, imams, but from excessive spiritual information I also begin to lose the whole essence of what was said. I have many plans, goals, but I am captured by laziness, masturbation, the feeling that my peers are already building a career, living, studying abroad, and I am a pimply, myopic guy who never went beyond his town. All my plans I always put off until tomorrow, but nothing changes in ""tomorrow"". I can't communicate normally with people, I stumble and carry complete nonsense. I wanted to commit suicide 2 years ago, but couldn't for some reason. I'm just afraid of a hopeless future, I'm afraid that I won't be cured, I won't be able to find a normal job, a girlfriend, take care of my family, etc. I have a strong fear of the unknown. That's all, thank you dear reader for reading.",

I have a family, a husband, a child, but I have no strength to think endlessly for myself, how to feed them (yes, this is only my concern, it is my own fault, I never saw my husband because of money) ... debts are already higher no roof, no property, no prospects. There is work, but the salary is unbearably lacking. I generally keep quiet about family relationships - they simply do not exist. I just owe everyone. I have no one to talk about it with. I'm tired. And I don't have the heart to commit suicide, probably ... I would have finished everything and that's it ...",

I will say right away that I always try to help my parents as much as I can: around the house, with money, etc. Even when I had a strip operation, I did not stop helping (I had no work at that time). We lived beautifully, there were never major quarrels and disagreements. Everything changed when my mother fell ill ... She was diagnosed with cervical instability and chondrosis of the cervical spine. Because of this, her head is constantly spinning, and she can hardly do anything. She became too emotional, unpredictable, began to constantly vent her anger on me (because I was ""at hand"" all the time). This is partly why I went to work. Mom's demands on me grew. Not only did I have to work, I also had to manage to do housework in a 4-room apartment, alone! And this despite the fact that I have a younger sister, who is 20 years old, and who does not help at all. Even so, I could do everything that fell on me, if not for two reasons:",

A wonderful girl. His mother had to move in with us to help with the child (I'm a student). We get along with my mother, she immediately accepted me, but I just can't come to terms with my role in the house. I am absolutely helpless and useless. The mother-in-law does everything she can around the house, sits with the child, is constantly in the house, does not go to sleep every day and until late at night.

1," everyone, my name is Vitaly, I'm 26 years old. I'll start with the most important thing, I'm tired of living, thoughts of early departure from life come to me. I will explain why, from an early age I was raised as an obedient boy, for this upbringing I now hate myself, everywhere there is good propaganda that you need to be a good person and then good people will reach out to you, that you need to be an open person and then everyone will know how cool you are , but in fact, in this world, almost all people are scared, angry and mercantile, trying to hurt you and spit in your soul. From childhood I was forced to believe in God, I still remember my mother's phrase when I asked her the question ""who do you love more? Me or God?"" the answer was ""God."" I always prayed to God, always went to church, always prayed for the health of loved ones and relatives and even enemies, as prescribed by the Bible and other holy scriptures, but in fact I became worthless, why should you respect me? For being so kind? For that I prayed for the health of people? No, they don't respect me, they only blame me, I always fulfilled the requests of people, sometimes even sacrificing my own interests, the way I was taught in childhood that good deeds will return you good, that's how they taught and honestly I didn't expect good at the beginning, Then I began to wait because the good did not come back, I stopped helping the person and in response I heard then a blackout, I was comfortable, that I did good to people, because who does not need a free slave?",

I love children, they see and hear everything and they live it with us. I cannot protect them from this. My husband works 2 jobs, I work part-time, but we cannot get out of debt. No more strength. I am a strong person. But apparently I'm breaking down. I can no longer say that everything will be fine. No, it will not. Everything will be bad and even worse.

I am 18, and from about 11-12 years old my life turned into a living hell. The last year has been a nightmare in general, I am surprised that I still live in this white world. Now I am writing here with tears in my eyes, but behind the wall I can hear the cries of drunken parents. To begin with, in early childhood I was the happiest child on the planet, my twin sister and I lived with my mother, my father left us, but he always walked with us, waited for us to visit and loved us. In my memories there are moments when he came to visit us and made us happy. Before us, my mother still had a son, our older brother. Mom gave birth to him at 18 years old from her husband five years older than her, I have never been interested in the details of her relationship with her husband. After the birth of her son, a year later, her husband hanged himself. I don't know the reasons why, my mother also doesn't know why he did this to her. After death, my mother was left alone in her arms with her little son, since my grandmother and her husband's relatives supported her, but she still managed to get depressed, my mother put her hands to alcohol. I know that she had a very difficult life during that period. From the words of my older brother, I learned that for 5-6 years my mother drank very hard, it came to ""fever"", she even caught a ""squirrel"", chariots and devils appeared to her, she even asked my little brother to strangle her by the neck, and he strenuously followed my mother's instructions. At that moment, he did not even know that my mother was suffering, her psyche was disturbed. Once she felt so bad and she turned to one grandmother who gave her a Bible. Mom turned to God and he heard her. A new page began in her life, my mother began to attend church and pray. By the time I was thirty, my mother had met my father. They met, but then they were still sure that nothing could connect them. After a while, my mother found out that she was pregnant, and she also had twins. Naturally, we were not planned, but by flight. I know that my father was a favorite of many women, worked as a bartender in a bar and was popular. He did not believe then that he would have children at the age of 39.",

It is clear that no matter how hard you try, you will still not know something. When I got 4, I cried. I constantly twisted myself that there would be a bad mark, but in the end I got 5. Every day, 24/7, I was under stress. I was shaking before every lesson. I would throw tantrums for any reason. I slept for 3-4 hours. I couldn't go to school if I didn't do something. I worked with a bunch of psychologists, psychiatrists, just different doctors, confessed and tried to work on myself. Nothing helped. Everything just got worse. Finally I collapsed. At the beginning of this school year, I started having severe migraines due to intense experiences. I went to the hospital where I fell ill with pharyngitis. Because of all these illnesses, I missed a month in school. Yes, I did most of my homework, but I have decent debts. And the most unpleasant thing is that I have to pass all of them. I'm afraid to go to school. I constantly have the feeling that they will eat me up there and will be sarcastic about the fact that I missed so much. Against the background of all this, I began to think about suicide.",

I am rarely allowed to walk, in the family I am only as a nanny and a cleaner. They gave me a tablet for 46 thousand rubles. She has expensive clothes for 5-25 thousand, and I have a maximum of 1500. Mom always disgraces me in front of everyone. She calls me a pig, a stinker, a nozzle, she called me once in class, and she yelled at me for calling her from school, although I did not call her, and she called me first. If I forbid Lisa something, she will yell at me and punish me because she is small. If I get 4 in I'm going to be punished at school. I can't live like this anymore, it's just, it's unbearable.

My appearance is not at all for such a career ... my sister said that I can not sing at all. I have no future. I don't know how to communicate with people. I currency exams not because I didn’t teach, but because I’m afraid to talk to teachers. I'm just afraid to talk to people. Why live at all? Everything will become much easier.

I can walk half a night. I have no desire to strive for something, set goals, learn, just live the way it is intended - there is no desire.

Due to the fact that almost no one perceives me as I am; due to the fact that I have to do what I do not want; due to the fact that I do not follow the rules of our life - I do not want to live like this and see such a life filled with that which is not interesting and unnecessary for me. I just don't want to live and see all these people, listen to the same thing, reassure myself with just one word: it is necessary.

I thought that I would earn and give everything, or rather I wanted to believe it. Six months later, quite large sums of money began to pass through me, some of which I began to lose, in the end I had to take out a loan of 400,000 to pay off the difference that I had lost ...

I became very nervous for no reason, everything pisses me off, especially the injustice at school, the lack of time for classes that interests me because of my studies. At the same time, I am too calm. I don't feel any reaction to events that should bring disappointment or joy, I have to pretend that I am happy / sad, that I empathize with the person or, on the contrary, am happy for him. But that's not even the point. I liked it because I suffered a lot due to trauma from the past.",
1,"She was born and lived for almost 40 years in Uzbekistan, then left with her family to Russia. My parents stayed in Tashkent. My family fell apart (divorce), the children grew up, they have their own families and their own lives. Now I had to quit my job and return to Uzbekistan, because my parents can no longer live independently. In Tashkent, I have no one left, everyone I knew either died or left. A month after my return to my parents, my dad died and I was left completely alone with my mother, a patient with Alzheimer's disease. Everyone I love is in Russia - my grandchildren, my daughters, my friends. I feel like a rat cornered, I understand that I have to be here, and every day I break myself, it is unbearable to communicate with a half-insane mother, I do not want to wake up in the morning, at every opportunity I try to leave home, I wander around the city alone. I don't want to live, nothing makes me happy, I want to fall asleep and not wake up. The main thing is that there is no way out. I have to sit in Tashkent and wait for the death of my mother, because then I can return home. It's terrible, unbearable. Nobody knows how long it will last - 2 years or 10 years. I went to the local church, confessed, prayed, but nothing helps. I can't take my mother to Russia, because she is a citizen of Uzbekistan and until she receives Russian citizenship, she will not receive a pension and there will be only paid medical care for her, we will not be able to handle all this. Moreover, in her condition, moving to another country will become an unbearable burden. I am very tired, what should I do and where can I get the strength to live?",

In September, everything was, as it seemed to me, good, but when I wrote a school math probe for 3, it alerted me. ""But this is a school probe, the next one will be better."" I said to myself, and when the first trimester ended, I got 3/3, at first I could not believe, because the grades that the teacher gave us in mid-October were in order, then when I asked how I could get such grades, she showed me that according to the last works I am 3 and these are the ones I made myself, without a tutor. I asked if I could fix it, but I was refused. I upset my parents, so much money and effort was invested, and then 3, as if there was no tutor ... I was told that if I get the same grade from a city sampler, I can forget about tutors, I can get out myself.

I'm an outcast in the classroom. I have never had friends: not in kindergarten, not at school, not in life. At home they constantly yell at me. Dad drinks, does not give money even for elementary trifles. Mom, who used to be the only faithful friend, now yells and condemns. I lost in the Olympics, for which I prepared very hard. School subjects are not given. I can't do anything. I have no talents, although I tried to develop them. Recently, memory has worsened. I have a terrible appearance. Short hair, difficult to comb. I am fat and very tall. And my main problem is teenage acne and blackheads. Points depend on oily skin. Indeed, I have it like that. A month ago I did face cleansing. This is a fairly expensive procedure, it was very painful. The face became clean, but after a week it was again covered with black dots. And acne - they are everywhere: on the back, stomach, arms, and more on the face. It is so terrible .. I try to look less in the mirror, on the street I pull my hat up to my eyes, but there are also pimples on my cheeks, which you cannot hide. Honestly, I've never seen people as ugly as me. I went around all the dermatologists in the area, everyone says different things, they attribute expensive ointments, tablets, etc. I followed all their directions, but the pimples won't go away.",

I studied there for less than 3 months, but I just can't get used to it. It happened that everyone started pretending that they were ill, and I decided, why not try my luck. So I went home. Everything was fine until everything was revealed. Mom was upset, to be honest, I already regretted that I came, but for that I had reason. Here, it was unpleasant for me that they (mother and grandmother) took it as something like a joke. Of course I understood that it was stupid, but the desire to go home was overpowered by all the ""against"" ... Of course, everything worked out later, but yesterday my temperature rose again and I came home, but on Sunday I pretended that my temperature was high: I got it. But in the evening I got hot. My mother does not tolerate lying. That's what I'm leading to. But, this time I had a reason, I didn't want to go there because of one person. Mom forgave me and everything seemed to be working out, but I still felt tense Yesterday I arrived home, but as luck would have it, the temperature dropped sharply, but my throat hurt. Mom suspected something was wrong, but understand - I’m not to blame for the fact that I was sent home. Mom is angry. I understand her, but she’s not with me. Today I went to the hospital, and everything seems to be fine, but my mother came to dinner angry. The reason for this is me. To be honest, she tells me that she misses, and when I arrived with the reason, she is angry, you see, I’ll miss school. I don’t understand again. Today I also asked if I squirted my throat, I said yes, but in fact - no. I don't know, I want to say one thing, but I say another, and this has recently begun with me.

1,"Good day. I ask for help with solving mental problems. 2 years ago I came to study in St. Petersburg for a technical specialty. I finished the first course well, despite the bad attitude of some teachers towards me. In the second year, problems began, there was a desire to change the faculty, and then I missed half of the semester due to a severe illness. Despite this, I got out of my skin and turned in everything except 2 items. The dean of the faculty did not go to see me as a foreigner, even because of illness, did not extend my session and I was expelled. The desire to learn was completely lost, plus the girl who confessed her love to me took her words back. My father was disappointed in me - a lot of money was spent on me and I let him down. A year later I came back for the 2nd year, now I am trying, but no basic subjects are given to me, plus sheer failures in my studies. They can be expelled again, I don't know what to do, if this happens, I won't be able to look at my parents.

1,"I am 17 years old, 11th grade, male. As a child I was very happy and could not even think that I would come to today's result. In short: it was not easy at puberty, constant conflicts with my father in the family, there were no friends - only drinking companions, no one understood me, non-reciprocal love (yes, I know how to love and distinguish love from a simple attraction, and I have been in love almost all my life, but in different girls (at 3) and in different periods of time, but unfortunately it did not work with any one due to my unsuitable external data), then alcohol, sleep for 4 hours, dissatisfaction with myself was added from above, and as a result - nervous overstrain and breakdowns. The feeling of total uselessness in the world, moral destruction and lack of purpose and motivation finished me off. At least climb the wall from the inner pain, but you continue to live by inertia. Only self-development prolonged life for a foolish heart, I read such enlighteners as Nietzsche and Kafka, Erich Maria-Remarque and various great poets, the Russian classics were also very impressive with their simplicity and coverage of problems, as well as hope: hope for a good future and faith in our own strength. Resurrecting and collecting myself piece by piece all these years left a residue and an indelible scar for life, and this summer (2017) I thought that everything was finally getting better, everything was hurt and now I will heal. But recently I fell in love once again and it tore me up again, but opened my eyes: I absolutely do not care about myself, my future, exams, I don’t need friends, I don’t need relationships, I don’t need a goal, aspirations, desires, and self-development doesn’t save anymore. I live like Pechorin, only burned out from pain, not pleasure, and I warm up my will in life with adrenaline. Recently, only anger directed at myself (I can't do it otherwise), and despair. I really want to live (I understand it well by living), not exist. Suicide out of a desire to live - which could be more ridiculous, but it is so. After all, I'm only human. Summing up, I want to say that I am not looking for consolation and I do not want to find a purpose in life, I’m trite and I don’t see the difference that you live for 300 years, that 30 - the outcome is obvious, I just want to know if you see a way out in my situation, when all this dirty world disgusting and absolutely no will, at all?",

In the morning, I feel as if I was beaten all night, I feel sick 24/7 ... Sluggish, I can hardly understand anything. I don't want anything, except to stop this existence.

I often brought her up and after she was gone, I began to blame myself for her death. This feeling is still there. After the new year and until spring I had a stressful condition, but since there were frequent quarrels with my mother + exams were on the nose, and one person spread dirty rumors about me after which I was left without any communication, and only doing my sport I was distracted from everything for a while. Having entered the university, I thought that everything, a new life began! But no, there is no communication in the hostel, at the University it is tight with some teachers, one might say they underestimate you, and in training there is no longer any consolation, since there is no my sport in this city, communication is also difficult. I never had a boyfriend, and I doubt that someone like me will ever have a family. I myself don't really like myself, sometimes I stutter and don't pronounce ""p"", I'm small and a little overweight.

1,"To begin with, my life with girls is very bad. Bad looks play a role. In college at the age of 19, I met a girl with whom we were only friends, but I fell in love with her, did not let her get close. I have spent 11 years with her to no avail. But another girl appeared, two years ago she began to write to me and we kept a friendly correspondence, and she was just a child for me at her 14. Two years of impassive correspondence. In September of this year, we met by chance in life. Accidentally ended up in one place at the same time. She is now 16 years old, I'm 30. But when I saw her, I was stunned, her legs gave way and generally fell in love. She looks about 20 years old. A gorgeous girl with black hair, brown eyes, tall, slender. Cheerful. Although she is often silent, sometimes she cannot be shut up. She began to catch me twice a week when I arrive and leave work. But in fact, not everything is so happy with her. She's a suicide. And she has frequent attempts. Once a month for sure. It doesn't work to convince her. As they began to see each other, after her first time, I convinced her to bandage her hand. Everything worked out, scratched the skin. When he met, he hugged her. wanted more. They began to kiss. And today she wanted complete intimacy, but I did not succeed .... This set her up in the sense that she would not be attractive to me. It seems to have calmed me down. I am ashamed and shameful. We stood in an embrace kissing and chatting sometimes jokingly. She said that next time it will definitely turn out. I don’t know what the reason is, or maybe it’s still from a two-year abstinence from women. But at the right time, dysfunction. In principle, nothing foreshadowed trouble. But in the evening she disappeared. And later she wrote that they had just brought me from the hospital. Sewn up. I even attached a photo. But why is she? I have to do something with myself! What does it have to do with it? Her parents do not allow us to see each other, since I am too older than her, and until the age of 18 she cannot decide for herself. Therefore, we meet in secret. The father is gone, the mother is drinking, the grandmother is weird, the pro-grandmother is already quite old. They live together. I feel sorry for the girl, and I can do nothing to help her. Over the years, the correspondence has become very close. And I probably love her. This is the situation. I don’t know what to do. But if she can die, then I will go after her. It doesn't matter how much it is possible, because no one came back from the other world and told what it was like. But there is a chance. I want to be with her. Even after my fiasco, I was very comfortable and pleasant with her, she is very caring. She is the best thing in my miserable life. And I have nothing to live without her",

Once I had a friend and once she said that I needed to do something with my appearance because I look like a piece of shit, then it seemed to me that this is individual and her opinion was dictated by her taste.

We haven't seen each other for a long time and she sent me to emergency situations because I don't bring her any special money.

Now I don’t know how to be ?! I don’t want to stay here, the town is small, there is no spiritual freedom here, and these questions about marriage are also tired. I want to finally live in so much for myself. But there is one thing, I turned to a lawyer in Turkey to help with the documentation, I started begging me, they say, will you come alone, and in the end offered to buy a ticket and even a room to the hotel, at their own expense. In short, you understand. In short, I won't address anyone, everyone has one thing on their mind. I'm a virgin, I don't know whether it's good or bad, but this And before marriage I'm not going to sleep with someone. But it's so hard to take care of myself from such people.

No, I will not say that they do not communicate with me and they hate me, I would even say that they love me in my society, they often told me that I am not like others (in a good way). And there are few like me. I am a kind person who does not harm others, I will always help others even if I feel bad later and I realize it. With people I am always joyful and cheerful, although it hurts inside. I don't even know the reason, it just hurts, sometimes I want to cry for no reason. I also often argue with my grandmother, but still I apologize all the time, although it is not my fault.

1,"Good afternoon. I have the following story. She worked for 17 years in a large holding, and has grown to the director of a production enterprise. She was always very emotional and responsible. I always expected trouble. There were fears all the time, but I tried to hide them. And at one point I became fixated on the fact that we have legal problems in the company. I myself am a lawyer. And she began to torment herself that everything was over and the enterprise would be closed. I got to the point that the shareholders saw this state and asked me. Previously, she was a very reputable strong and purposeful person in the holding. The enterprise was built in a bare field from scratch. I don't know what happened, why it broke. I always took responsibility for all the work and went ahead. Now I am nobody. I am 40. A child of 8 years old, whom I wanted to give everything. Husband, not support, as he earned very little. And they never loved each other. She pulled everything herself, probably overstrained. Now I work as a lawyer in the same holding, finalizing cases. The collective turned away, the shareholders, with whom they have been a confidant all their lives and do not promise further work. My deputy became the director instead of me. It turns out that she launched the schavod and gave everything to her deputy to work. You cannot call a fool dade. The godmother of my child works as a chief lawyer in the holding and does not want to work with me, explaining that one negative comes from me and, accordingly, the shareholders, with such a position, will not leave my friend at work as a lawyer. Maybe somewhere I did not treat the Lyulam correctly, but I didn’t serve such a betrayal either. I broke my life, everyone turned away from me. It is her own fault, she allowed herself to be trampled. I do not know what to do. I cannot live without movement as an active person. Having such potential destroyed everything because of the folly of obsessing over fears. I look at the child and cry how I can now raise him to his feet. It was because of him that she did not sleep enough and worked like a horse. The thought of ending the gathering is constant in the head. I am ashamed in front of the child for being irresponsible. I look around and there is no one nearby and there was no one. Everyone has happy families where everyone supports each other, loves. Men earn money and women take care of children. I have none of this and the child already understands it. Unbearable pain torments me. I live like a zombie. I understand that the end will soon be. I have to look for a job, but I understand that the age and pay are completely different. It is morally difficult for someone to obey and humiliate oneself. It's scary to start your own business. If I get a job, I’ll be afraid that they’ll be kicked out and then generally a pension. Terrible story, stalemate, dead end. Lost weight 2 times. I eat practically nothing. I save. I want to finish all this and not spoil the life of the child, since he also suffers in this negative melancholy and nonchalance. There is no one to help. We are alone with the child. If I die, maybe my brother will take the child, there is a normal climate in the family and my son will grow up not as a neurasthenic, but as a normal person. I don’t even know what to ask you, I understand everything myself, but in my situation it is all the more impossible for a woman to endure.",
1,"1 year ago I entered the university. I really want to get this specialty and do not see myself in another profession. But on the 1st year such a situation occurred. I stood facing the window, with my back to the aisle. A teacher came up from behind and said: “Girl why don’t you greet me, I’m going to teach you something later”. I was shocked and dumbfounded, because I didn't even see him! Then he came to our group and really turned out to be our teacher, moreover, the one who takes the exam. From the 1st year in this subject I have only two grades, I began to find fault with the appearance, and I teach and try to tell, but he either interrupts anyway, just sits me down. In April 17, the first suicide attempt. But I told the police that I just took too many pills because of the headache. I was not registered and had a history of a short-term depressive reaction. But now the second academic year is already underway, and the teacher is behaving the same way. On the last topic, he called me to the blackboard, and I stumbled on every word and my head began to bump, as if something was hitting the parietal bone from the inside. He sat me down, and my classmates said that I was covered with red spots. I can no longer teach and I hate this subject and the teacher. I know what emotional intelligence is and I have an understanding of the situation, but I can't help it.

And before that everything was fine, I went with hearing aids. The doctors prescribed an operation, I already left, but the operation failed due to the fact that the analysis showed that I had a bad liver. Everything was going well, but before the operation itself it was a bummer. Soon I am going to the same operation again, but the question is whether it will take place or not, the altitude is again slightly increased. But not like then.",

1,Hi i am 14 years old,
1,"! I don’t want to live, because I am completely different from other people ... I have big problems with memory and remembering, I cannot remember what I did a few minutes ago, I cannot remember even a small amount of information because of this large Difficulty finding a job, I forget about job interviews, I can't learn the information I need to work, I can't remember the names of people. It is difficult for me to understand what is happening to me. I tried to change my life, but everything I do I forget. I get confused in thoughts, words, I can’t keep up the conversation, I don’t understand what they say to me. Every day I feel worse, my eyesight and hearing are deteriorating, I practically cannot formulate my thoughts, my speech has become difficult, I only cause pain to my family, since in soy years I can not do anything on my own. I am afraid that at one point I will forget to turn off the gas or do something irreparable. I see no future in my life. I am afraid that I do not remember anything and do not understand. That's why I don't want to live this life anymore.",

Because of this, I am afraid to express my opinion, to contradict and so on, in other words, I am ""zatyukan"". And as if I, on the contrary, to everyone with love and soul, even to her, but from her I even hear the notorious ""fellow"" 10 times a year, heh.

1,"! I will share the story of my life. We have been living with my wife for 12 years, we have two children, the eldest son was not his own, he was two years old when we met, but the youngest is a native. Well, here we live, an ordinary family, work at home, everyday life, children grow up slowly grow up, start mixing with their parents, the eldest son generally ignores the words of his wife, I start screaming, my wife starts screaming at me as a result of constant abuse. My wife began to constantly say how tired I was of everything, tired of cooking, tired of getting out of romance, no love. We live in a small village in which there is no where to go, hunting and fishing well into nature with a family trip. The relationship did not go well, sometimes they even began to sleep separately when we quarrel, you will not hear an affectionate word at all. Then the wife says, let's try to have a third child, well, in short, the wife was examined, I was examined, it turned out to be a sad picture, my wife had a cyst in the uterus, my sperm cells were not active, they were treated, they were treated with a lot of money for this. My wife generally started yelling at me over all sorts of things, finding fault with me, like a warden. Once I drank pretty well and didn’t talk about too much drunkenness, called me. In short, my wife rented an apartment and left with the eldest son, while the youngest stayed with me. Of course, we work together in the same department, everything is fine at work and the attitude is normal, sometimes I help my wife to do her work, she calls me to a rented apartment to make a tap, then an outlet, then drop in to eat at my wife, and come to her home to wash. She took only the necessary things. Well, I ran to the light regularly, have sex, once or twice a week. In short, a month later, the eldest son came with his things and speaks with his mother it is unbearable to live. So we live, the wife separately enjoys life, and I am with the children. Officially, we did not get divorced, so we lived, met at work, had sex at lunchtime or on weekends. We lived like this for seven months, friends of course were all shocked by us, we went to parties together. I have said many times to my wife enough nonsense to come back home until I have a rest from you. One day my wife was not at work, I also asked for time off early, the children are at school. I come home my wife is sitting at home, and I'm waiting for you to talk, and she says I cheated on you and also got pregnant for five weeks. I have a lump in my throat, it was a test in my head, well, accordingly, she was in tears, sorry, I'm sorry I don't want to break up the family, it happened like that, let's leave the child, forget about everything, just forgive. My wife returned, and I just pretend that everything is fine with me. I was on a hunt, thought to shoot myself in the head and let him do what he wants and does, stopped the children, I'm sorry I can't leave them. This is how we live, my wife has become affectionate, kind, and hatred for her inside eats me, what to do?",
1,"I'm Selfish and Loser. I destroy everything myself with my own hands. I ruin the lives of loved ones and myself. I spoil things, mow at work and I can't do ANYTHING about it. Sometimes there is a feeling that some kind of self-destruction program is running in me, and I launched it in myself. I also like to step on the same rake, I know where it will lead, but I do it anyway. I can't sit still, I am constantly in a hurry somewhere, because of this I am nervous. I will plan one thing, and I do another. I do not believe in a positive outcome of the planned case. Sometimes it is very difficult for me to put up with myself, I am my own enemy, a stranger to myself. I torment myself and those around me, when I need to do something quickly, I wildly start to blunt and slow down. In general, I'm desperate. I don't know how to live further.",

1,"Good afternoon everyone. My name is Andrey, 34 years old .. Every morning I wake up thinking how to die as soon as possible. At the age of 20, he dropped out of the university, got rid of the army, occasionally worked part-time (not officially), but for the last six years did not do anything. One comes to understand that something needs to be done, study or work, but with any attempt to do something with oneself, an unreal stupor attacks oneself to move oneself from the ""familiar place"". I can't explain it, it's just that everything inside shrinks into a lump, some kind of shaking begins. I live with my mother (68) and my sister (she herself did not have a very good life, she is almost 42), who support me, but at the same time understand that there's no point in me. Although we are glad that I am not an alcoholic or a drug addict. I stopped communicating with my father (63) 13 years ago on my own initiative and I regret it very much, but I don’t know how to contact him. There is practically no communication with people, I have lost all my acquaintances for a long time, I am sitting stupidly in VK, communicating in chats, because I have forgotten how to communicate with people. I do not live in fantasies, but I often go back to the past and cannot comprehend why I did all this with myself. I understand that time cannot be returned, but I am losing my mind from my present. I visit thoughts of suicide very often, I can say and live these thoughts, about different ways, but thoughts immediately appear in one half of my head that my neighbor will be terribly bad (including after conversations with the cops who will need to testify so that at least the body is returned from the morgue), but on the other hand I understand that I myself cannot hold on any longer. I want it and that's it. I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself and I'm not looking for pity from someone, I just don't know what to do. If you ask me if your roof is going, I will answer yes.",

I'm already tired of fighting everything. I don't want to accept everything. I sometimes feel happiness, it's so incredible. But, I'm ready to give it up if I die.

Relatives are against me making my way into life as a musician. I don't want to get into the army and then fight for the devil understand what. There is no communication with people. Constant anxiety, stress, a lot of phobias. My mother wants to kick me out of the country to study for a specialty that does not touch me in any way, I do not know what can be learned without desire. Many do not even have such an opportunity - you will say, but why would I need an opportunity that does not make me happier? I even tried drugs to somehow relax. Not heavy. I drank. But nothing, some kind of emotional stagnation, I do not feel anything but fear and anxiety. More and more often I start to think that it would be easier to just commit suicide. This is some incredible swamp. Help with advice. You are welcome. I don't know how to live, I don't see any meaning in life at all. Guy.",

I started drinking and smoking when his mother was 13 years old. Now I have become aggressive, because of any little thing I want to kill someone and start to create some kind of game. Once I beat a classmate, after that I was caught by her boyfriend with his friends, they had a fight. And then they almost put it on record. After this incident, I became even more inadequate. I have no father, died, and my mother doesn't care what happened to me. We live quite poorly, but I don't give a damn, I don’t want to complain about that. I can’t sleep normally anymore, I’m thinking how best to end all this, but I’m still afraid.

1,"Привет, мне 16 и я хочу покончить с собой. Вообщем то я тихий и замкнутый в себе человек года два назад я боялся даже заговорить с девушкой или незнакомым мне человеком (у меня реально начиналась паника) поэтому друзей у меня практически не было,но в классе 8 я познакомился с девушкой из своей школы она тогда была в 10,естественно мы познакомились в интернете чисто случайно.Я забыл сказать,что плюс к моей замкнутости и скромности я не очень то красив,не то чтобы урод,но ниже среднего,а эта девушка старше меня на 2 года к тому же красавица не с того не с сего начала проявлять интерес к такому чмошнику как я, поначалу мы общались только в интернете,но потом она начала подходить ко мне в школе ,она позвала меня в свою компанию из таких же красивых и успешных девушек и парней как она (ну,конечно если так можно выразиться) понемногу я стал более раскованным,общительным уважение в школе ко мне поднялось ,после того как все увидели,что я гуляю со старшеклассницами ,я поверить не мог ,вот я забитый чмошник был готов покончить с собой,но теперь благодаря 1 человеку, 1 девушке моя жизнь так круто изменилась. Мы так же хорошо продолжали общаться и конечно же я влюбился в нее,я не знаю может быть она это заметила,но воспринимала она меня только как лучшего друга,наверное даже младшего брата за которым нужно следить и вести его в нужное направление ,я не знаю,почему эта девушка вдруг решила так помочь мне,черт лучше людей за свои 16 лет я не видел.Да много воды я уже настрочил,наверное потому что я настолько поражен этому человеку, в наше время такая добрая душа одновременно с красотой,очень редкое сочетание.Я решился признаться ей в своих чувствах,хотя к тому времени я думаю,что она точно заметила их,я хотел признаться ей на ее день рожденье,написал для нее красивый стих,хотел чтобы все было красиво,я хотел все сделать по максимуму для нее я был готов на все,да и сейчас готов на все ради нее,но за неделю до дня рождения она взяла у меня телефон чтобы зайти вк,она конечно же уже не впервые его брала для этого,но на этот раз она не вышла из своей страницы (может даже специально) конечно любопытство одолело меня и я начал читать переписки,и наткнулся на переписку с ЕЕ ПАРНЕМ ИЗ ДРУГОГО ГОРОДА (она периодически ездила в другой город якобы к сестре,она не кому не рассказывала,что у нее есть парень и об этом как выяснилось потом знали только 2 ее лучшие подруги)теперь она постепенно отдаляется от меня,а по концу этого года она уедет к сестре учится и мы будем видеться очень редко. ВОТ ТАК В ОДИН МОМЕНТ РУХНУЛА И БЕЗ ТОГО ВЕТХАЯ ЖИЗНЬ КОТОРАЯ ДЕРЖАЛАСЬ НА 1 ЧЕЛОВЕКЕ,ДА МОЖЕТ Я МОЛОД И ГЛУП,НО ЭТО ОНА ВЫТАЩИЛА МЕНЯ,КОГДА Я БЫЛ НА ГРАНИ,ОНА ПОДАРИЛА МНЕ ВТОРУЮ ЖИЗНЬ ,НО ЗАЧЕМ ЧТОБЫ ПРИЧИНИТЬ ЕЩЕ БОЛЬШУЮ БОЛЬ ?????????? У МЕНЯ БЫЛ ТОЛЬКО 1 СМЫСЛ ЖИТЬ ОНА,НО ТЕПЕРЬ У МЕНЯ НЕТ И ЭТОГО. Не знаю зачем я вообще сюда это все написал,просто выговориться иногда нужно всем.Да сейчас мне очень больно,пока что я держусь,но когда она уедет я не знаю что мне делать,это так глупо,но мой мир основан на одном человеке и это больше, чем просто юношеская любовь,она так помогла мне,без нее я бы и сейчас если бы не покончил с собой,то остался бы забитым чмошником и задротом,отбросом коим и был всегда,а теперь она оставит меня тут гнить, будет невыносимо больно...

1,"Good day. I'll call myself Beatrice. I am 16. Those who think that I am too small to understand life, that I have seen too little, you can immediately pass by. During these 16 years I have experienced everything that is possible. Death of mother, poverty in the family, alcoholism of relatives, uncle-drug addict. All my childhood I was forced to plow. Leaving home at 7 am I could come home at 10, hungry and tired. After that, do homework, take care of pets, listen to lectures for every four in the diary (1 hour for 1 four, without exaggeration, each time this lecture took exactly so much). Naturally, there was no time for friendship and entertainment, so I grew up as an introvert, closed in myself. I understand that these years have benefited my skills, but what do you know about when you can't even say  to friends, you don't know how to talk to people, you sit in a room and pray, no matter how someone comes in and something or didn't ask? I have a good appearance, I can Photoshop better than many small shops can afford (in the sense that they are not giants in trading on the benefits of a magnet, sushi shop, and the like). I read books, write poetry and prose. I can play guitar, not bad as a gamer. I draw and cook well. Why am I doing this? Besides, I am able to adequately assess my abilities. In contrast to all this mainstream crowd, who think that everyone should have low self-esteem. I managed to love a person so much, I trusted him so much, but in the end I was abandoned. This is not love, like a girl and a guy. These feelings are much deeper. Because of which, I became even more distrustful of people, hate them. More than once I have become the center of some company, some organization (I don’t know what other word to choose, besides this) in the shortest possible time. In two or three days she could become the one to whom they had been striving for years. I'm still a good student. But. It's time to move on to the problem.",
1,"Доброго времени суток. Мне нуюно выговориться. Устала и нет мотивации для жизни на данный момент.... Вобщем не сложилось с самого детства. Отец был военным и вся наша семья уехала с ним на границу. Я себя помню с 6ти лет, потому что меня изнасиловал, точнее совершил действия сексуального характера подчиненный моего отца...я даже помню его фамилию до сих пор...на заставе все друг друга знают и в военном городке тоже... но ему ни чего не было по моему....короче я росла и помнила, росла и ненавидела всех, ни кто меня не водил к психологу и т.д. В семье спустя некоторое время, уже после того как мы вернулись в свой город к бабушке и остались жить в ее доме, в семье начался разлад, отец нашел другую женщину и начал встречаться на стороне, мать не выдержав измены начала пить, в доме не было даже соли не говоря уже о какойто еде, мы с братом проводили время на улице, мыли машины, собирали бутылки и т.д... в доме был уже притон и по этому мы там не оставались....брат начал воровать, он и раньше воровал у родителей деньги и убегал из дома, но теперь это было уже у чюжих людей....я держала себя в руках, может быть из за ненависти к людям.... мать умерла когда нам было 13, умерала она не мучаясь, в пьяном угаре думаю не больно, мы ее кормили чем могли и переодевали, она была очень хорошим, талантлевым, чистоплотным и хозяйственным человеком, но спиртное убивает все на корню.... к ней пришли  2 мужика и я помню их и я знаю кто они, она была уже наверное без сознания, потомучто она не сопротивлялась, они сделали  свое черное дело, а потом мы обнаружли что она мертва, ну потом как положено скорая и милиция....сказали что у нее опухоль головного мозка с вклинением в позвоночную часть.... Отец помог похоронить ее, мы сами ни чего не могли сделать и я веню себя за это тоже... Остались мы на попечении бабушки, она великая женщила! Она как могла воспитывала нас, но брат так и пошел пт наклонной, он украл у менч все и бабушки, милиция не помогла, ненавижу их тоже за это.... он тоже начал бухать, просто в дрова, иногда его находили на улице и привозили к дому а я затаскивала его в дом.... но я другой человек, да я была забитым ребенком, с кучей страхов и не уверенностью в себе, но я решила хотябы научиться защищать себя и бабушку и пошла в спорт, на рукопашный бой, я заработала кучу медалей и званий, выполнила норматив мастера спорта..И теперь у меня бвло оружие.... много раз у меня рвало крышу и я била брата, а недавно ударила   начальника, за не справедливость, потому что слова не работают....ну да ладно..... вобщем жили мы так  жили, мы с бабушкой смотрели за домом платили за него не малые деньги, брад же был паразитом, он только гадил, просил еду и деньги, угрожал и бухал....Год назад моей бабушки не стало, это было как нож в сердце мне.... Агония была ужасная.... брат был дома но он был бухой и я пыталась облегчить ее муки сама, не забуду это... скорая ее не спасла...но она прожила хорошую и достойную жизнь...я одна устроила похороны и поминки как пологается, соседям спасибо и бабушке что накопила  денежек,брат не помог ни чем, а он нажрался на поминках я у него забирала спиртное.....вобще  дом на мне остался, я одна плачу за него, за один газ только 4600, так как не могу счетчик поставить....а не давно его затопило....пришлось брать кредит на дренаж и отмостку....вобще в долгах....  я делаю все по дому, могу чинить краны, копать, сверлить, пилить, вобщем все а брат ходит и упрекает меня....я не могу продать дом если вы об этом, у меня нарушения в документации которые я исправляю уже 4й месяц...вечно у них проблемы в конторе... это реально кабала....я схожу сума...с личной жизнью все плохо.... я боюсь, а точнее мне стыдно за моего брата и за то что дом в таком состоянии и я не могу приглосить даже друзей....их только 2е но они лучшие.....но на самом деле я ненавижу людей, особенно мужского пола....вы уж простите, не в обиду...если найдется парень который примет меня такой какая есть, потому что я челоаек не простой и упертый, зато есть дом и машина...типа завидная невесть &#128514;иногда мне хочеться бросить все и закончить существовать, по моему это проще помучаться 5 минут, чем мучиться всю мою чертову жизнь.... сколько можно....а еще больше я ненавижв себя, у меня слишком занижена самооценка другип говорят, но я реально ненавижу себя за все что отражается в зеркале и за все мои действия или даже бездействия, я ненавижу себя за то что я боюсь......помогите, держаться нету больше сил......",

1,"I am 16 years old, I am rejected by society, an outcast everywhere. I am from a bad family - the mother of Shabold (gave birth to me at 17, I also have two younger brothers, we are all from different men), divorced. At one time I even lived with my grandmother. I live in a small town where everyone knows everything about everyone, so I can't have friends. I come to class and no one talks to me. Mom does not know how to distribute and plan the budget, so there is always not enough money. I dress at random, constant ridicule in my address about this. I always studied well, I never had Cs in a quarter or a year. Now I'm in the tenth grade. The stepfather did not allow to live in peace, he constantly broke something, smashed and spoiled things. The apartment is in a terrible state (the glass in the doors is broken, lamps and chandeliers, a stove ..), we are moving soon. Problems in my family could not but affect my academic performance, poor grades appeared. In the summer before the 10th grade, I met a boy from my school. He has a decent family, many friends, he is in demand. I have no one but him. He doesn't know about my problems. I guess I won't last that long. If we stop communicating with him, I will be left all alone. I have a good friend, but she lives 500 km away and we rarely see each other. Just one question: how not to go crazy and survive?",

1,"Здравствуйте,это не просьба о помощи и даже не исповедь, зачем и для чего это всё пишу... я наверно и сам до конца не понимаю. Даже не знаю когда это со мной началось, наверное тогда- когда я родился. А родился в обычной среднестатистической советской семье на задворках страны. Не сказать, что- бы я чем- то выделялся, но и похожим я на сверстников никогда не был. В детский сад я не ходил, на улицу тоже- вернее гулял только во дворе под чутким надзором мамы и бабушек, уже тогда мне было не комфортно в обществе детей- одногодков, я всегда предпочитал общество взрослых. Да, и  ним меня небольно подпускали- ""бить будут!"" говорили. Дальше была школа, в школе действительно били. Дрался постоянно в 90% получал люлей, за что?- за то что трус наверно, за то и получал. Учился плохо- потому что тупой, рос физически нескладным- болезненным, из- за чего и пропускал уроки, общего языка со сверстниками найти не мог, друзей не было да и откуда им было быть. Белая ворона в классе , мне не нравился ни тяжёлый рок ни шансон, я был не похож на них, смелые и нахальные, физически развитые, шумные и словоохотливые- я во всём был их антиподом. Тихий и забитый я не мог не спросить, не сказать, не ответить, не постоять за себя, да и сейчас наверное по большому счёту всё это не могу.  Сколько себя помню- постоянно мечтал уехать, вырваться из нашего маленького городишки с его порядками, нравами и гопотой и уехать в город Н (миллионный мегаполис в 200 км. от нашего моногорода). Мы туда часто ездили к родственником и переехать и жить там было тогда моей мечтой. Так прошли школьные годы и я наконец- то получил так мною долгожданный аттестат. И поехал в город Н осуществлять свою мечту, но экзамены в универ благополучно завалил, т.к. тупой. Правда я тогда не сильно расстроился со своим ""сибирским"" здоровьем в армию меня конечно- же не взяли и год я провёл сидя дома, смотря в окно и читая книги (вообщем делая тоже, что и делал в школьные годы в свободное от занятий время). На следующий год я поступил в техникум в нашем городе. Тогда- то жизнь начала по немного выравниваться (как мне тогда показалось), появились друзья, общие интересы. Да и люди в технаре были совсем другие, не такие как в школе- умнее что- ли, интелегентние. Вообщем жизнь начала налаживаться- студенческие собрания, гулянки и т.д. и т.п. Далее, мне всё таки удалось отчасти осуществить свою мечту и поступить в университет в городе Н, где я проучился 3 года, родители были против, что я уезжаю, но смирились. Здесь я увидел совсем другую жизнь, других людей- умных, целеустремлённых, уверенных в себе и  жизни. Я исам тогда был уверен, что всёё только начинается. Я даже стал успевать по части учёбы, мне нравилось ходить на лекции, познавать что- то новое, слушать и общаться с интересными людьми, да и сам я изменился.  Мне даже удалось построить отношения) Надо сказать что с девушками я общаться, вообще не умел и не умею, вернее сказать я конечно общаюсь с ними, но это лишь деловое или же дружеское общение, многие одногрупницы меня считали хорошим другом и не более. Но, завести отношения с ними...вот чего я не умел и не умею. Да и половых отношений у меня никогда не было, они меня никогда не рассматривали как мужика. Нет, у меня конечно был секс, но это был секс за деньги и не более. И вот наконец я встретил её Света была старше меня на год и училась там же на 5 курсе. Она была не такая как все остальные вокруг. Между нами сразу пробежала искра и мы сразу начали общаться с ней, мне легко было говорить с ней обо всём, оказалось, что мы очень похожи как две капли воды- общие интересы, мировоззрение, взгляды на жизнь и т.д. и т.п. Наши отношения развивались стремительно и уже через пол года я решил, что женюсь на ней. Какой из этого скандал вышел... родители и с её и с моей стороны были категорически против! ""Закончи институт сначала, найди работу что- бы смог обеспечивать семью"". Света закончила учёбу год сидела без работы, не могла найти, я подрабатывал что- бы не сидеть на шее у родителей и иметь хоть какую- то копейку, но денег всё равно не хватало. Далее она работу в гос. органе в другом городе, а у меня начались преддипломные и т.д. Встречались всё реже, всё реже созванивались, звонил в основном я. Она постоянно ссылалась на занятость (даже вечером и в выходные) нервничала, истерила. А потом вообще порвала со мной, объяснив что более не любит меня и не видит со мною будущего. Универ я закончил, но работы не нашёл нигде не брали- говорят ""нет опыта,"" да и не могу я молоть языком и производить впечатления, как другие. Остальные одногрупники устроились кто куда в основном на блатные места и со мной отношения не поддерживают. Пришлось уехать назад в свой моногород, в котором не осталось предприятий и организаций- все закрылись, а люди уезжают отсюда, кто- куда. Встал на учёт на биржу труда, пытался устроиться в гос. органы- но везде отлуп! Не служил  армии, не прошёл по конкурсу,не подходите и т.д. и т.п. Полтора года сидел на шее родителей без работы. Устроился не по специальности вахтовым методом на месторождение в Ямал, но выше слесаря не поднялся, т.к. ничего не умею делать и соображения не в чём нет.",

I ran after me for 1.5 years, begged me to return, but I was afraid although I loved very much. A young man appeared for about 1.5 years, but I realized that no matter how hard I tried to forget, I still love my husband, moreover, even more than before. I wanted to return everything, he still loves me too, but he has a new family now and just a child was born, and he cannot refuse them. In despair I do not know what to do, for a week I have been crying in iterations, I want to die, the pain eats away at me unbearably.",
1,"Мне 38 лет. И все 38 лет моя мать не принимала меня. Вышла замуж и Родила меня  от алкоголика, который бил и пил разумеется, ещё и гулял. А тут беременность и я- никому не нужная. Моральные принципы не позволили сделать аборт, ведь она верит в Бога, или скорее делает вид, что верит. Так в ее жизни появился выродок, и ничего с этим она теперь сделать не может. Я ее дочь и теперь уже на всю ее  жизнь.  Моего отца посадили, и мать быстренько развелась. Но так всю жизнь и называла меня выродком. Сначала я даже не понимала значение этого слова. Понимала только то что это что то оч обидное и плохое. Потому плакала. Потому с самого детства, самым близким человеком была превращена в жертву. Меня всю жизнь унижали и били. Бил и отчим , а она стояла рядом и говорила: ""Еще! Еще ей дай! Еще!"" За каждую провинность, за плохие отценки ( ну какая уж тут учеба, если дома такая нездоровая обстановка?) Даже за мелочи, и за те избивали, называя выродком. Так получилось, что ребёнком меня поймал сумашедший маньяк и изнасиловал. Мне было всего 10 лет, и я была просто испуганным существом, над которым вдоволь наиздевался взрослый дядя с ножем. Я умоляла отпустить меня, я не понимала, что и зачем он со мной делает. Я только плакала и боялась что он убьет и не отпустит. Отпустил. Я бежала по снегу через поле в соракаградусный мороз. Бежала к людям, бежала за помощью к домам где горел свет. Замерзшая и зареванная не верещая что осталась жива. Боялась, что он передумает догонит и всеже убьет меня. Тарабаня по окнам в паре домах, мне всё же открыли две женщины. Пожилая и молодая, наверное мать и дочь. Слушая мой сбивчивый рассказ пожилая плакала и причитала: ""сто же это делаеться?!"" А молодая смотрела на меня испуганно, во все глаза. Они и отвезли меня домой. Ведь он завез меня куда то далеко. Моя мама, да после всего она все равно остаётся мамой для меня, она сказала, тем женщинам, что она в шоке... Но самое страшное началось, когда они уехали. моя мать начала меня УБИВАТЬ! Я серьёзно думаю, что она хотела меня убить. Оказывается что изнасилование ребёнока, это не самое страшное! Хуже когда тебя избивают потеряв контроль, причем так что не могут остановится, притом при всем при этом это делает, после всего что с тобой произошло, та женщина что родила тебя. Та что должна тебя не только защищать но и любить. Она рвала клочьями мои волосы, пинала, рвала в разные стороны мои ноги. И зубами рвала мою кожу. Я уже не могла кричать, я понимала что не что меня уже не спасет. И помощи мне неоткуда ждать. Думаю этим она навсегда испортила мне психику и я уже никогда не перестану быть жертвой и никогда не смогу ей простить всего этого, при всем моем желании. Когда все закончилось, отбросив в сторону одежду что она на мне разорвала, и посмотрев мне в глаза, она серьёзно сказала"" Какой позор! Как жаль, что он тебя не зарезал!!!"" Вот такая вот материнская любовь! Полностью оставив меня голой в комнате, даже мои трусики она порвала. Она закрыла меня в комнате и ушла.  Дальше я уже ничего не помню, вродебы от всего того ужаса, я потеряла сознание. И с того момента я превратилась в выродка который с десяти лет шляется по мужикам, в ее понимании я сама хотела, я грязная шлюха у которой в 10 лет уже чесалось. Это мерзко! Это омерзительно даже. Она мне все время напоминала, что я грязный выродок и шлюха с 10 лет. Я никогда не смогу ей этого простить! У меня не было детства, лишь унижения, что продолжаются до сих пор, а я до сих пор ищу в ее глазах, не любовь, а хотя бы то, что она наконец принимает меня. Все зря! Как скорпион, что постоянно жалит. Она не просто критикует, а дает каждый раз понять, что я ничтожество в ее глазах, и прощения что я существую мне нет. Не могу ей даже отвечать на ее выпады. Замираю, как кролик перед удавом... и умираю каждый раз когда думаю, в кого я превратилась. В кого превратила меня она... и за что мне все это?! И почему действытельно такой выродок, как я был не зарезан в 10 лет? Странно, что даже слез у меня не осталось. Только внутри дрожь, будто рыдает та маленькая девочка...",

At the age of 30, I finally understood that something needed to be changed - to go to work, to study. But I could not do so with myself. So I lead a parasitic lifestyle, thank God without drugs, alcohol and all kinds of games. I am in an incomprehensible stupor when one half of the head realizes that it is necessary to tear the ass away from the familiar place, and the other half denies it all. There is a mess in my head, one garbage. I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself, but I also can't understand how this could happen to me. The past does not go out of my head and it is impossible to distract the sebch. By nature, I am socially phobic, maybe because of this, problems arose at the institute, then on part-time jobs. For a long time there is no communication with anyone (sometimes it is difficult even to communicate with loved ones). Family members are trying to support me somehow, but they themselves do not understand how to get out of the corner into which I drove myself. They have thought about suicide for a long time, but every time my cowardice stops me, although the desire to die is very strong in me.

1,"Я закончила вуз этим летом. Пол года безуспешно пыталась устроиться на работу. Меня приглашали на собеседование, а потом посылали. Везде и всегда. Специальность - журналист. Многое здесь решают связи, которых в Москве у меня нет. Была жуткая депрессия, отсутствие сил, смысла жизни. Я много пила. Я пила каждый день. Это было ужасно! С начала ноября приняла решение что-то изменить, пошла на курсы мастера маникюра. Уж им то точно сейчас можно устроиться, очень востребованная профессия. Там мне действительно понравилось! Я ходила первые две недели с горящими глазами! А сейчас опять накрыло. Заставляю себя всё делать из под палки. Потому что вечно атакуют мысли, что я получу диплом и опять начнётся эта канитель с поиском. Я вспоминаю, как рыдала после каждого собеседования. Один раз вообще случился приступ астмы на улицы (хотя я не астматик!). Я рыдала, а потом начала задыхаться. Мне вызвали скорую. Я боюсь повторения того ада, что пол года был в моей жизни. Без денег, без друзей, с беганьем по крысам-работодателям. Благо муж поддерживал. На его деньги и живём. Но очень хочется иметь какую-то свою копеечку. Он меня никогда ни в чём не попрекал, не отказывал в потребностях, баловал. Но я хочу хоть чуть-чуть на ноги встать уже. Ну сколько можно! По специальности пробовать больше не хочу. Журналистика вся продажна и гадка. Да и не возьмут. Вы спросите, зачем училась? Да чтобы просто диплом получить, который на полке лежит. Четыре года убила за так. Мысли, что меня не возьмут мастером маникюра меня убивают. Я сразу начинаю искать варианты, и остаётся только продавец или кассир. Или официант. У меня не укладывается это в голове. У меня высшее образование, я очень много читаю, пишу стихи (есть два сборника, сайт), прозу, знаю языки, разбираюсь в искусстве. Я творческий человек, воспитанный, интеллигентный. И как представлю, что я у прилавка стою, то жить не хочется. К чему это всё? Зачем? Зачем я столько училась, творила, писала? Чтобы с быдлом картошкой торговать и слушать их мат? Ни секретарём ни менеджером не берут. Никем. Нет опыта. Возможно, я рано отчаялась. Ведь я еще не закончила курсы мастера маникюра. Может всё и сложится неплохо. Но память возвращает к тому чудовищному периоду жизни вновь и вновь. Я больше не вынесу ТАКОГО поиска работы. Мне нужен человек, который каждую минуту будет говорить мне, что всё хорошо. Как болванчик. Подозреваю, что у меня скрытая депрессия. Год назад меня уже лечил психиатр. Но сейчас нет денег на него, да и подсаживаться на препараты больше не хочется. Лечили от тревожно-депрессивного расстройства. Я очень хочу, чтобы его не было. Я уже кофе перестала пить, стараюсь пить меньше алкоголя. Тяги нет, но как только представляется случай (обычная посиделка в баре или в кафе), я нажираюсь в сопли. Утром жалею. По два дня болит сердце теперь после таких гулянок. Провалы в памяти. Я всё теряю и забываю. Доходит до абсурда. Я как ребёнок. Я стараюсь меняться, но не выходит. Мне сложно сконцентрироваться бывает. Очень быстро устаю. Вот просто нет сил! Из потребностей только стихи. Не могу не писать. Не считаю себя великим автором. Если бы у меня не было необходимости работать (ну представим, что есть какой-то капитал), я бы посвятила жизнь творчеству. Писала бы и писала. На маникюр пошла просто, чтобы деньги потом платили. Хоть крохи. Скажите, как побороть апатию? Как убрать эти мысли? Только не к Богу. Я не верю. Поверить себя заставить не могу. Мать у меня тоже неудачница. Росла с ней с мыслью, только бы потом не стать как она. И, видимо, повторяю её судьбу... Правда у меня нет мужа психопата-алкоголика, который избивает до крови. Я себя слишком уважаю для этого и люблю. Мать с бабушкой живут далеко. Я давно уехала из того города, нет желания даже в гости приезжать. Общаемся по скайпу. Иногда всё же возвращаюсь на праздники в то болото. Окунаюсь в атмосферу нищеты и безысходности. Как представлю, что и этот диплом будет насмарку, хочется убиться. чувствую, что сделаю это когда-либо. Мужа жалко. Любит очень. И я люблю. Но реализоваться хочу в жизни. И хочется и колется. Сил нет. Апатия мешает К бесплатному психиатру без московской прописки меня не возьмут. Читала всякие книги, шизотерику, психологию. Ещё больше запуталась. Как вылезти из этого ада? ",

I could not find a place for myself after that: I slept badly, I had no appetite, I was all in thoughts of her. A month later, they took me into the army. I thought I would forget about her in the army, but no. Even there I was every day all in thoughts of her. I wished her a Happy New Year, March 8, her birthday. Once I managed to correspond with her. She was very glad that I wrote to her. After the army, I confessed to her that I liked her, but she said that I did not. True, the next day she said that she thought for a long time about my sympathy. She has a difficult character. She used to be rude to me, but I still don't hold a grudge against her, because I love her. Now our communication has stopped, she ignores my messages. Already three days.

In general, I have been married for 29 years already for the third year, but since August there have been strong misunderstandings with my wife and she went to her place. After some time, she filed for divorce, which was a shock to me, because we didn't even fight with her. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, and I’ve never cheated and never raised my hand to her! But I waited and believed that everything would be fine! For three months I lived without sex, endured and waited for us to make up and everything would be fine! But after three months of abstinence my brain was no longer working and I sinned with an unfamiliar girl, there were thoughts that it was not worth doing this, and as if someone was trying to cheat me, ""Come on, you man, sleep with her, and that's it."" And I ran into a girl who specifically infects healthy people with genital herpes. I don't understand what I did wrong to her. After intercourse, I hated myself so much for what I did! I was disgusted with myself! And after 4 days I started an adventure called genital herpes! And the joke is that this infection is incurable, it is forever with you in your body. It seems that they learned how to send people into space, invented the hadron collider and much more, but did not learn how to destroy the herpes virus. Soon the last trial with her beloved and she seems to be thinking of returning. But I don't want to infect her, ruin her life, because she is still young, her life is just beginning. But I can’t live without her. I also can't look for another wife, knowing that you will infect her. And living alone with this infection is the end! I don't understand people who deliberately infect people with incurable diseases. Why are you doing it? The rest are not guilty of anything! I think to let go of my beloved and ... I see no way out! I don’t want to live alone, but looking for someone to infect is also not an option!",

Literally 3-4 years ago I had all the work, family, apartment, and everything was fine with finances, but on March 8, 2014, everything changed. On that day, my mother-in-law and I had a fight and she took my wife and child to her place. To be honest, she gave me a job for which I am grateful to her, but because of this quarrel, she influenced the fact that I was fired from work under the article. Since then, I have had no luck. There was no quarrel with my wife, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I never cheated on her because of a purely external factor. The divorce was because of my mother-in-law, she didn't really like me, to be honest, I don't know why. In general, due to the fact that I could not find a job, I started playing in the bookmaker (the stupidest decision) now I have debts.

They refuse or they just throw it into the archive. The resume is kind of good but they don't want to take it. Because of all this, I am depressed, often there are thoughts of suicide, it may be so easier, but when I imagine my mother in tears, I myself cry. I don't even want to imagine it in my thoughts. My mother is everything to me, she always believed and believes in me, and I let her down. But it’s very difficult for me now, I want to tell her how I feel, but I don’t want her to worry.

And I expressed my desire to be with my father in every possible way, since after the divorce of my parents, I hardly saw him. I always cried, after coming from the kindergarten, I fell to the floor, straight face, and began to cry. I remember being taken to a child psychologist, I was often ill, was in the hospital almost every month, it was lonely. By the way, I understand, now I understand that it was not easy for my mother. She pulled permanent hospitals in cities like Moscow, EKB. My father did not pay child support, but sometimes, every two years, my father would wake up in him and he would walk with me. But then he disappeared. He died as a man. When I was 11, I realized that he was dead to me. I was 13, he appeared in my life. He tried to improve relations, introduced him to his woman, who, by the way, was naturally not the last. He later disappeared again. I decided to stop communicating with him. I cut off all connections, got a new phone, stopped answering unfamiliar numbers, since he constantly called from others (to his home), once he was guarding my entrance when I was getting ready to school. I then skipped. I didn't want it again. A week after that, he disappeared. But after about six months he appeared with a New Man. It was Olga, the mother of my classmate. He lived with her and her daughter (Daughter and son from his first marriage) for about six months, just from about the moment he disappeared again. He decided to start communicating again. I don't know how it turned out that I agreed. Did I miss this? I do not know. I can't even explain to myself how it happened. I went to my paternal grandmother for the summer. Soon my father, Olga and now my half-sister of ten years arrived. Upon returning home, I was invited to their wedding. I often went to visit them, as I became friends with Veronica (my half-sister) and she often invited me to visit, but I could not refuse.",

A typical situation threw my intimate photo (of course, I don’t know, maybe I was lucky, but this photo that I sent was on the half of my face, but it’s bad that my rings are visible there ...) to a kid from one school (but the fact is that this kid is not 16 or 18 years old, but 14 and he is now in grade 8 ..) at first everything seemed to be fine, but 2 months have passed and he throws mine pictures (they were just the same type, on the floor of the face, chest) and his brother writes, at you ???

1,"! My name is Diana. I am 26 years old. I really need your help . I feel that I have lost myself, interest in life and have forgotten how to enjoy life. It's not easy for me. My father died when I was five years old. Mom has been on her own mind all her life. All my life I am all alone. Youth passed under the inadequate control of an aunt suffering from alcoholism and always accusing me of not having her own family. My nervous system is not entirely in order, but thanks to faith in God, I did not lose heart and fought to the end. Relationships with men did not work out and ended tragically for me. As a person, I was not very interesting formed. Moreover, she was terribly jealous. This frightened off men. This year started off happy for me. I made friends, had fun and met someone who was not like the others. Calm, with a good sense of humor, smart and incredibly likeable. We had a lot in common and fall in love with him at first sight. For the first time in many years, I felt happy. After telling my aunt about it. She began to put pressure on me, twitch my nerves, control and drink immensely. Every day she finished me off psychologically. I began to be jealous of my beloved for no reason, to write nonsense, made many mistakes. Aunt's last blow was a call to him. She scolded him with her last words, adding at the end of the threat. I lost him forever. Every attempt to get him back ended in failure and hysteria. Three months have passed, he still hates me. He considers me a fool, crazy, etc. I seem to have withered. Closed in myself, moved away from everyone. I've lost weight and look like a living corpse. I really want to live, but my health and appearance make me stay at home. I still cry. My Soul Hurts. Recently my cat died and it killed me. I don’t know how to live on. There is no hope for happiness. If you can give advice Thank you. May God give you well-being",

Naturally, I sat in silence in the lesson, but nevertheless I still tried to get involved and understand something, tried to solve the exercises Throughout the lesson, there was a girl who laughed at me.

1,"На самом деле всё нормально, это не крик о желании уйти из жизни (хотя и такое было) , я просто ищу совета. Мне просто тяжело. Тяжело из - за того что я люблю девушку которая живёт со мной в одной квартире. Мы с ней ""расстались"" 2 года назад, она уехала в деревню на пару недель, встретилась там с человеком с которым долгое время контактировала когда мы были вместе, ну и соответственно бросила меня, потом вернулась домой и живёт тут до сих пор, и будет жить ещё долгое время (повлиять я на это никак не могу). И с тех пор в моей жизни началась бесконечная пытка. Я постоянно чувствую боль, чувствую себя угнетённым, не на что нету сил. Доходило до того что я ложился в псих больницу что ""вылечить"" это состояние душевной боли, но не помогло. Она приводила домой того человека с которым изменила мне, я в этот момент просто как загнанный в угол зверь выл от боли в комнате. Меня преследует постоянная душевная боль. Уже второй год я чувствую гниль внутри каждый раз когда ложусь спать от того, что понимаю, что она в соседней комнате. Меня будто копьём пронизывает от того что я слышу как она сопит во с ней в соседней комнате, или сексуально стонет когда потягивается или поворачивается. Я долгое время терпел, мне очень сильно хочется ударить её, за всё то что я пережил, за всю ту боль что я испытываю, но у меня не поднимается на неё рука, да и как я могу ударить девушку? Вместо этого я тупо орал как бешенный, угражал ей, просил, молил, что бы она уехала. А ей есть куда, из за этого ей только увеличилась бы дорога до учёбу на 30 минут, но нет. Ей нормально, ей комфортно. Каждый день, я нахватаюсь стрессов вне дома, я уставший, у меня совершенно нету сил, я прихожу домой, хочу отдохнуть, а там она с порога. Стресс усиливается, чувство усталости удваивается, я стараюсь не выходить из своей комнаты в квартире что бы лишний раз не чувствовать её присутствие. Из-за постоянного стресса я стал просыпаться по ночам, не сказать что я раньше хорошо спал, но то что происходит сейчас это просто кошмар. Я не могу нормально взаимодействовать с другими девушками, вроде есть те, которые очень привлекательны для меня, но я прихожу домой и мои чувства снова переносятся на неё. Даже если я проведу ночь с кем нибудь другим, я прихожу домой и всё начинается по новой. Мне не выносимо смотреть как она наводит марафет перед встречей с другими парнями, нет сил слышать её голос каждый день. Я невероятно устал, я не знаю что я могу с этим сделать сейчас. Теоретически я смогу переехать из этого места через 3 года когда закончу учёбу, я пытаюсь подрабатывать но этого никак не хватает на съём квартиры. Каждый день превращается в бесконечное страдание когда она рядом. Плюс ко всему она ещё и невероятно привлекательна (возможно я думаю так из за любви которую испытываю к ней), так что ища другую девушку я сравниваю её с ней, и почти всегда они проигрывают ей в красоте... Наладить с ней отношения никак не получается, мы и так были слишком разные, она любит встречаться с друзьями, а я наоборот избегаю компаний, она любит общаться не о чём, и тут же об этом забывает, я стараюсь говорить только о деле, она любит танцы и веселье, а мне как то комфортней на лавочке в парке. Сейчас мы совершенно не общаемся, и даже когда я находил в себе силы начать с ней разговаривать, это приносило мне всё те же гнилые чувства, я часто срывался на гнев в разговоре из-за той боли которую испытываю. Я не знаю, что делать! Из-за этого постоянного негатива у меня нет никакой жизни, нет сил работать, учиться, тренироваться. Было время что я концентрировал эту боль и у меня срывало башку, я опять же орал и угрожал, сейчас я тупо плачу в комнате, из за того что очень люблю эту проклятую дуру и нечего сделать с этим не могу, 23х летний взрослый парень всхлипывает в своей комнате. Мне так больно.",

I ran to doctors osteochondrosis 2 hernias in the cervical spine, treatment, exercises, nothing really helps and the strongest neurosis stopped sleeping altogether. I ended up in a psychiatric hospital. You can't lift a heavy I have to work. I asked the management to transfer to work easier, but also the salary became lower. As a result, the condition in terms of osteochondrosis is a little better, but tinnitus, numbness of the hands, especially at night, the therapist says everything from nerves, drank antidepressants, nothing helps. Neurologists say accept with this exercise. Who needs the sick, I'm afraid of losing my job, but as it turned out I can't do anything else.

There are two classmates who sometimes write, in real life I have not seen them for 2 years. And the last times, when I spent time with them, they constantly asked me why I was silent, although I was mega comfortable with them. I can't keep up the conversation on the Internet either, although there were an incredible number of attempts to find friends - the result was zero. Outwardly, I, as well as in communication - complete horror. But the appearance practically does not bother me any more, because I understand that people can be attracted by charisma, and not by a painted face, but how can one develop this very charisma ?? In different circles, where there are common topics of conversation, there is also a black sheep, so this option of communication also disappears. Everyone, even parents (especially them) constantly call her abnormal, finished and other affectionate words that I don't even want to remember. Of those few acquaintances, no one calls for a walk, everyone shuns, but I see no point with new people.

I fell in love with my husband so much that at 6 months of pregnancy, having learned that he was a drug addict, I tried to fight. He died when his daughter was 6 years old.

We slept in our clothes and covered ourselves up to the top of the blanket with jackets. I went to another country, left my daughter to my mother. There was no exit. But she almost loved her granddaughter. I took my daughter by making a residence permit. I earned two apartments in this country, a house and land in my homeland. Now my daughter doesn't need me. I don't need it, she says. She forgot MY beggarly life. I didn’t refuse her food and clothes, I myself didn’t eat for several days. Kindyrs, ice cream, and all kinds of sweets were always with her.

This year I entered college, everyone thought I would go to the budget, but, no, I entered for a fee, did not pass on points.

1,". I am 15 years old. For a long time, thoughts of suicide come to me. Yes, sometimes they disappear, but soon they return again. Earlier, suicidal thoughts appeared solely because I hated myself, I was disgusted to look in the mirror. Since from a very young age my classmates, well, in principle, not only them, hammered into my head that I was fat, scary, that I don't even have a father, etc. And I was very quiet, and of course I could not respond to insults. I still can’t do it in principle. Now I just began to spit on the opinions of others who do not cause me any feelings. I don't care what they think, I'm not going to listen, because I don't trust. Everyone has different opinions. If earlier thoughts were only due to a lack of communication (I did not have friends) and insults, now I simply cannot understand who I am and what I am. That is, the meaning of the fact that I exist, the meaning of all this. I don't know what I want to do, I have absolutely nothing, hmm, or interests, I just can't force myself to do something. For example, go in for sports or play the piano (which I abandoned after 6 years of music school, as I already said, I can not bring myself to). Because I will die anyway sooner or later. I don't know who to go to study. For my mother, the most important thing is the assessment of the assessment, although it always says ""you should know for yourself."" She says that the meaning of her life is me. But ... Damn, I'm still confused. I don't really see any sense in anything. I have friends. Those who know that I have depression, very frequent, they tell me that I'm crazy, and just call me to walk to distract me, and they succeed. But when I am alone again, in a house that I hate (often at home alone, my mother works constantly) again the thought that I would rather just die and feel nothing. No pain, no frustration, no fear, no joy. I just won't exist. Of course, there is such a person in life whom I love. Love in my understanding is just attachment. We walk with him, talk, I just try not to show my anxiety. I don’t see the point even in it, because after a while we will simply stop promising. I am happy and good with him. But, coming home, again, I ask myself. What for! He often tells me about himself, about his hobbies, about his goals. I also want to do something. And what can I tell him. Am I a dull nonentity who sees no point in anything? And the meaning should be there? Or just one I need it. There were suicide attempts in my life, but yes, I did not want to die, I wanted to go to the hospital, and I can realize at least something. But I'm afraid of pain. So I drank <honey. and chem. drugs> and a lot. I got stomach and heart problems. I was losing consciousness, but then I felt better again. Of course, my mother did not notice all this, she is at work. But I once wanted to bring myself to such a point that it would not be possible without suffering in the ward. Maybe then I'll start to appreciate life. And now I just don't know what to do ...",

Nothing in my appearance is good. For example, the cilia are short, the hair is very fluffy, barely combed, hair grows everywhere, and much more, it takes a long time to describe. They look at me like an idiot. I have no friends, do not believe me, not a single girlfriend. The only thing I can do is paint. If not for this, I would have been even worse, because the drawings calm me down. Sometimes I come home and cry, I scratch my hands, I have grown my leg especially for this. I tell my parents that the cat scratched. When my mother tells me that I am beautiful, I feel somehow offended. Others, on the contrary, are happy, but for some reason I can't. I also had a tame sparrow, we often sat together, he tweeted cute, sometimes slept. But he died on the 26th. I cried and cry to this day. I am very sad now. I watch mysterious films, scary ones. I go to school with a very sad face. But this is no longer because of the sparrow. If there are any high school students, boys or girls, it doesn't matter, I just want to disappear. I look at my thin and beautiful classmates and my soul just loses itself. I feel so ashamed. I am the tallest in the class, the fatter of all, the ugliest of all. I have pimples everywhere, on my shoulders, on my arms, my face is just full of them. It even seems to me that I will be alone, always, I will die alone. A guy will never come up to me. I don't even listen to my mother, because mothers, as always, calm their children down, give them compliments, etc. Not one mother will say bad things about her child. Well, I laugh very rarely. Most often I am sad and cry. Parents are not at home, they work from morning to night. I study more or less. I really want to die, but I live for the sake of my parents, although it is already intolerable to live. Behind my back, they always start gossip and point fingers, but I'm already used to it. I look at life in gray. When I stand in the school hallway, it’s like I don’t hear anything, I have a lump in my soul. I am so ashamed when someone just looks at me, even some animal. They will answer me: We must strive for the goal, lose weight, etc. People, I hardly eat at all, I have been going to the gym for 2 years. I observe everything. And what's the point? There is no sense. I do not know what to do. I'm just getting fat and that's it. And I'm getting uglier and uglier. Please help me, I can't live like this anymore. I oppress myself every day. I really ask you help",

Mom stopped communicating with me because she is on the side of her husband. The sister only calls when she needs something. For my stepfather, I don't exist at all. It seems like there are relatives - but nobody needs me. I will die - no one will notice. At night I sob into my pillow and ask that God took this life.

I found a new job, but the previous employer took a long time to return the work one, everything dragged on and the new employer did not want to wait.

I ran through all the businesses in my small town, but everywhere the same answer. There is no work at all, the city is very small. At this time, debts grew, and at the same time, uncertainty about the future grew. I tried to distract myself from bad thoughts, not to fall into apathy. He was interrupted by small earnings. I went in for sports, read books, went out with friends. I tried to build a good face on a bad game. But time passes, and there is no way out. Now debts have grown very much, there is nothing to pay back. Tomorrow I will have to tell my mother that there will be no money at all, and there will be nothing to eat. There are no relatives, except for the mother. I can't ask my friends for help, they are in trouble themselves. Yes, and I have already asked, they helped, but I can’t ask for more.

1,"На работе выбешивает главный бухгалтер. Требует какие-то дурацкие расчеты по отпускам работников при этом не говорит, как именно их нужно оформить или какой период брать за основу. На все попытки выяснить, что ей нужно, она всегда кричит на меня и говорит, что я как осёл ничего не понимаю, а расчеты обязан предоставлять ей потому что это так записано в Законе о бухгалтерском учете и у неё изменились в этом году какие-то бухгалтерские проводки. Совершенно очевидно, что она издевается. На этой неделе в среду она опять накричала на меня, что я опять неправильно сделал этот расчет. Разговор был на повышенных тонах и я ответил, что больше не буду составлять ей никакие расчеты, пока она письменно мне не напишет, на каком основании я должен их делать и подробно не разъяснит, какую именно информацию я должен ей предоставить,каким образом я должен составить расчеты и форму такого расчета. Короче, я сыт по горло этим откровенным издевательством. К начальнику обращаться за помощью бесполезно, так как он недавно пережил инсульт, стал инвалидом и считает бесполезным делом вправлять ей мозги, тем более ранее при устройстве на работу просил не писать всякие служебные записки и докладные по таким поводам, так как у него больное сердце и инвалидность. Таким образом, я один на один с этой бестией. Самое непонятное то, что после разговора с этим человеком, я очень плохо себя чувствую: у меня повышается давление, сильно болит голова, я очень плохо сплю, а потом никак не могу сосредоточиться на работе. Такое чувство, что имею дело с настоящим вампиром, который устраивает скандалы по пустякам, чтобы пить мою жизненную энергию. Помогает горячая ванна с морской солью, травяной чай и таблетки от давления, но это всё ненадолго. Завтра опять идти на работу и опять придётся встречаться с этим вампиром, так как организация, где я работаю в отделе кадров, небольшая и спрятаться не получится. Раньше работал в более крупных организациях и там главбухам некогда было заниматься такой ерундой, а тут прям не знаю, что делать. Увольняться тоже не выход, так как она наверняка будет обзванивать другие организации и характеризовать меня негативным образом. Мне 33 года, я холост, до сей поры девственник. Я так боюсь потерять работу и остаться у разбитого корыта, что на личную жизнь не хватает ни времени ни сил. Ещё больше переживаю, что мне по жизни не везёт с вампирами и если я буду искать женщину для создания семьи, то очень большой шанс, что она будет таким же вампиром и у меня не останется выбора, кроме как покончить с собой. В жизни не было ничего хорошего. Когда был ребенком, сильно заболела мать и мне пришлось выполнять очень много работы по хозяйству. Практически у меня было детства из-за этого, так как свободного времени у меня никогда не было, а обязанностей было хоть отбавляй. Меня постоянно избивал старший брат, который меня просто ненавидит и открыто желает, чтобы меня выгнали с работы. Отец вообще со мной не разговаривает, потому что я живу один, а он не понимает, почему я до сих пор не завёл себе семью? Короче, поддержки мне искать неоткуда, а так тяжело на душе, что хоть вешайся. Все выходные читал, как отвечать на хамство на работе и понял, что никак. Единственный выход, по словам психологов, это повышать самооценку, но как если тебя все презирают, даже близкие люди? Я даже не хочу, чтобы они меня хоронили. Хочется просто пропасть без вести.",

1,"Здравствуйте всем. Я Владимир, мне 31 год. Прошу у вас помощи, дорогие люди. Я зашёл в жизненный тупик. Не знаю даже, где я свернул не там; возможно делаю что не так, или думаю. Родился и вырос в полной среднестатистической семье. Родители мои, в преклонных уже годах, сохранили атмосферу и любовь в доме. Дали мне все, что могли. Все детство и юность я был активным и энергичным человеком. На внешность не урод, физически полноценный. Проявлял лидерские качества. Получил высшее образование, потом отслужил в армии. После армии удаленно отучился на дополнительную специальность. С 17 лет работаю параллельно с учебой. Все проходил- и стройки, и пилорамы, и грузчиком; раздавал листовки, переезд квартир. Цену рублю знаю. Когда я стал свободным от учебы, снял квартиру в области и начал поиск карьеры для себя. Упорно зависал на сайтах работодателей, кучи собеседований, по 2-3 собеседования в день. И так длилось пол года, параллельно работал кладовщиком+грузчиком. За пол года поиска.....я ничего не нашел-то ""вам перезвоним"", то ""нашли более успешного кандидата"". Думал, чем я прокаженный, стал поднимать в сети инфу о том, как сделать резюме правильно, как себя вести- вообщем ""как себя продать"". Я решил сделать паузу, захотелось подкопить денег и купить машину. Вообщем, что-то произошло со мной...Мне стало на все наплевать, я стал агрессивный, я перестал брать трубку, позабыл друзей. Стал выпивать, курить сигареты. Я постоянно после работы валюсь от усталости. Мне лень идти за продуктами по выходным, лень готовить. Я не выхожу на улицу, кроме работы. На работе отношения перестали ладиться, меня раздражают все. Меня все упрекают, а чхал на их жалкое мнение. Меня не увольняют, наверное, что я просто делаю свою работу хорошо и в срок. Со всеми поругался, я говорил себе-все это временно и все наладится. Итог такой- я в таком состоянии уже 6 лет. Я живу на съемной квартире, у меня нет ни друзей, ни авто, ни женщины(никогда и не было). У меня нет целей и желаний, я постоянно уставший, постоянно хочу спать. По выходным я посасываю водочку втихую дома. Я старался выбраться из этой могилы, пошёл на спорт, но надолго меня не хватило. Сегодня утром я проснулся и первая мысль в моей голове была: Кто я? Зачем я?. Покатилась слеза...в последний раз я ее видел в детстве...Я уже и не знаю ,что говорить с людьми, деградировал. Мне ничего не интересно и я не понимаю почему. Меня не радует музыка, я не видел в жизни моря(есть возможность, но я почему-то отпуск предпочитаю проводить дома). Сильно похудел, питаюсь скудно-лень готовить. Позабыл про дни рождения родственников. На сайте знакомств познакомился с девушкой. Кое-как, заставил себя выйти в свет. Купил дорогую официальную одежду и атрибуты, сделал модную мужскую стрижку и пришел на свидание. Посидели в ресторане. Девушка рассказывает о себе, а я летаю где-то в воздухе, половину речи ее и не принимаю... Вообщем, я понял, что никому нафиг не нужен мужик со съемной квартирой, без машины и работающий на складе. Но не велика беда. Хрен бы с ним. Я понял, наверное я умер... Уже в тягость даже помыться утром перед работой! Что за Хмарь со мной...О суициде думаю последние два года... Страшно как-то, в гробу некроз с вылупленными глазами-нее, та не хочу. Но и жить дальше не живу.",

I grew up as a normal child, studied well, went in for professional sports. He was raised alone, I am a doctor, I worked a lot ... .And at a transitional age, something incomprehensible happened to the child, and the doctors rolled their eyes, as if they had not heard about these diagnoses. You have no idea how it was when the child was normal, and suddenly practically disabled. Episodes of the disease were replaced by remission. I graduated from university, it was not easy, I have success in sports. Right .. I got married. His girlfriend knew about health problems, always supported him. What now !? - the aggravation of the sore lasts the third year, no combination of drugs helps. I was in the hospital, it was easier, then again ... Fears, thoughts prevail. Constant thoughts about death, attempts were made. Now at the day hospital, but refuses to go, because nothing helps. I was glad that I could work with a psychologist for free. It's funny. She apparently does not want to bother for ""so"", tries to shame that it does not work, gives some stupid examples. The son leaves her in hysterics. And in general, the doctors are angry that their schemes do not help us. Because of fears, my grown son cannot stay alone at home, and he cannot work either. For the same reason, he cannot live with his wife as it should be. Mostly with me. He only has friends from the hospital, just like him. I am a doctor, I cannot work by profession, I work in the evenings, and that work is temporary. I run home running. I live on the top floor in fear of causing myself nothing. I can only help my son by giving him a soothing injection. Here is such a doctor. Relatives are already accustomed to the fact that the son is in such a condition, they don't even call ... In general, it’s not cancer, but it’s impossible to live. He was exhausted. And I, too, already give up. I know how I can kill myself, for sure. But as a son, even as a deliverance. After all, I can’t. It turns out, wait for him to do the first, and then I ?? horror. No way out. Here they immediately write about faith. I do not reject religion, I know a lot of prayers, and I used to take my son to holy places. It looks like my faith is weakening. I can't pray for a long time, I just forgive with my words the resolution of the situation. I don't care anymore, either life or death, I'm not afraid, because this is not possible !!! Hell, I'm not afraid. here we have hell. I don’t feel God in my soul .... So it’s a shame, I can do a lot of things in life, and repair and sew professionally, I love tinkering, I can even repair cars ..... But just why do I need it given ??? nobody needs it. Protecting my sick son ... I wrote here out of despair and in the hope of help, advice.",
1,"It all started when I lost my mind. I didn't want this at all, but damn it, I could not overcome these thoughts that haunted me every mother of his second. As a result, I was diagnosed with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. I was prescribed pills, but they don't really help me. Because of this, not only I got it, but also my parents, who are already not easy. I exhausted them greatly with this, I understand that it is terrible, but I can’t help myself. Seeing how I suffer, they feel bad too, which depresses me even more. As a result, I had a feeling of overwhelming guilt and severe depression that this all happened to me and that my calm and carefree life ceased to exist. Plus, to all this was added the fact that I entered a prestigious university. It would seem, what could be so terrible here? First, it's hard for me to adapt. Second, since I have no friends, I am lonely, I have no one to spend my free time with. Therefore, I am very sad. Third, because of my confusion and inattention, I cannot cope with organizational issues. Fourth, I am asocial, and this prevents me from communicating normally with people. I want to communicate, but I can't. And all because of my appearance, because of which I really cannot be considered pretty. Fifth, lately I have been more and more disgraced. Probably because of my clumsiness. Sixth, my episyndrome. Or convulsive readiness. Some say so, others say so. But the essence is the same: my nervous tics, which have become stronger lately, very much interfere with my life. So close to epilepsy. Although, with the pills, there are fewer of them, but still it bothers me, since it seems to me that it attracts too much attention from people. At school there were fewer of them, and they were not as pronounced as they are now. This is probably due to my mental state. More than once I was visited by the thought that it is better to give up all this, because it is very difficult for me here.

It was hard for me to get used to what to do. another person, I would not say that I met just communicated in social networks, it somehow distracted me from all this from heavy thoughts so as not to go crazy, now life is completely unbearable pain, but I feel so sorry for the children I feel bad But they are even worse than me, he was a good man, he just lost many of his sister, brother, mother and it was hard for him and I could not help him and decided to run away because I could no longer bear this pain. We have a difference in age, he was 10 years older than me. Please advise what to do, in the morning I wake up with the thought that I do not want to live, I want to go there to him, during the day it seems to let go ...",

I got married a second time, but I didn't want children anymore, my husband is 8 years younger, there are no children and he really wanted a child, that's understandable, in general they decided. On the ultrasound, they said a boy, I got sick, I never wanted to have a son, but I tried to persuade myself that if only I was healthy and then I’ll get used to it, the pregnancy went well, the child was born and everything was not bad until I realized that something was wrong with the child, in general, the child is disabled, he has autism. The earth has gone from under my feet, who knows what it is, he will understand me. I am with this crazy child for days, I cannot accept him, God forgive me, but this is hell, there is no one to help, the child screams for days, God, how tired I am, my husband plows like damn I don’t see for days, but this child is screaming, running, but what to say is sick in the head, I can’t give it up, my husband is against it, doesn’t fully believe that my son is sick, but I endure and quietly hate, I hate myself, I hate the child, I hate the whole world I made a decision, I don’t want to live like that, I don’t want to live at all, I don’t want anything else, this wild oh for days, I can’t, I want silence, just silence, I want where it will be quiet.",

1,"I am a wheelchair user. I am 14 years old and I often think about death. I can’t do anything. Mom dresses me up, does everything for me. Teachers come to our home. Even there I feel terrible. I immediately notice those items that I can't get. I immediately think that I am stupid, and even more so I have no future. I dream too much. All this seems to me such a fairy tale that it hurts. As if I have not a life, but a solid dream. I often think about what will happen if my parents die? I’m nothing without them. Hanging around the neck of your older sibling? Call someone for help? Be humiliated? It's better to die like that! ""No future"" is not my invention. Do you understand? ""No future"" is my life. Since it all crumbles as soon as my parents die. I'm still a teenager. He writes so much on the Internet that ""Teenagers are sometimes rude, behave badly, become more aggressive"" and so on. And how should disabled teenagers behave ??? Climb the wall? Tearing your hair? How??? I'm not your average teenager! Previously, my classmates often visited me, but then they just spit on me, forgot their words about ""Oh God, you are such a nice person and it is so nice to talk to you !!!!"" were just empty sounds. I have continuous complexes. My classmates are tall, very thin and slender. They visit fitness, flaunt in social networks with their figure and chest. And I don't like to be photographed. Unless I have a lot of makeup on. But even so I don't feel more confident. Therefore, I have friends only in social networks, and I sit in them every day, every hour and minute. Autumn is my most hated time of the year, since my dad leaves for another city on a business trip, and my mom does not have the opportunity to take me out on the street herself, and I can not go out until my dad arrives (2-3 months) ... In autumn, these thoughts come to me most often.",
1,"A little about myself: 20 years old, student, sitting on my parents' neck. There are no friends, relationships with girls in any form - too. The circle of interests is very narrow: study (however, within the framework of the curriculum), cinema, computer games. Earlier I was interested in design, Photoshop, languages, cultures of other countries, programming, but I did not develop in these areas. It's just too lazy to get new knowledge.",

Scandals began, he began to beat me. We lived with his parents, but they only made our relationship worse. I went to see my mother, but when he arrived six months later, he promised not to drink, I came back .. Our son was born. He did not drink for a year. After a year, a nightmare began ... My husband drank deeply, shouted and yelled at me. He doesn't give a damn about the child. Doesn't go to work. We live on my salary and the pension of his parents .. Every day in the morning I wake up from the grumbling of his parents .. yesterday I received my salary, but today it’s empty in my pocket, I can’t even buy anything for a child ... He left drunk again, but I have thoughts only about death ...",
1,"This is not to say that I have never been happy or that I have always been unhappy with my life. There were times when I liked her. But this happened so rarely that it is easier to say that it did not happen at all. I have an older brother and two sisters (older and younger). The family has many children, so love has never really pampered me. The elder brother was the last freak, he often beat, mocked and all that kind of thing. Mom closed her eyes to this, even when I called her for help. She always believed him, not me, believed that only he was always right and had the right to everything, because he was older and smarter. It hurt me very much. It was because of my brother that I tried to commit suicide the first time. I was about 10 years old then. And it’s not surprising that my mother did not love us, because my father simply hated her and constantly came home drunk as a lord. He tried to forget himself, he did not like his life. Because of him, I developed a strong dislike for alcohol and smoking. But I got in touch with an unsuccessful company and already at the age of 13 began to break away in order to fall out of this reality. At the age of 14, I lost my virginity, not because I was madly in love with that guy, but because I wanted to feel needed at least for a while. That first guy was a womanizer and when I started to fall in love with him, I disappeared for him, although he did not grin too much. I often went all out, and then hated myself for it. But I met a girl who saw something good in me, accepted me as dirty, brainless, incapable of anything, and I wanted to become better. It was hard, but I tried. I didn’t drink anymore, started eating normally, fell in love with books, studied, entered the university and on a budget, completely changed my social circle, started going to church. In general, she radically changed her lifestyle. But you can wash off the dirt, change the shell, reshape, but what is inside will remain the same and cannot be changed in any way. This is what torments me. I want to be good, loved, needed, but I constantly do something wrong. For half a year now, almost every day the thought of suicide comes to me. I go through all sorts of scenarios in my head how this could happen. And I would have done it a long time ago, but one circumstance interferes - my faith. Not to say that I am a very strong believer, but it is forbidden to kill yourself, and whoever does this will burn in hell. That scares me. I admit the possibility that this may not be, that everything is invented and false, but if not? And these thoughts torment me. It’s like I’m at a crossroads, but since I can’t choose the road, I just walk straight ahead and hit the sign, because I cannot decide. It scares me very much that more and more I think about how to finish all this, and then come what may and less and less afraid of punishment for it. And every evening, lying in bed, I want to scream and beat like a butterfly on a lamp. And only one thought in my head ""Help ...""",

The worst thing about it is that wherever I am I am always haunted by failure, and in addition, I have never gotten along with the team, humiliated at school, humiliated in college and Now here in the army. I'm already so tired of all this that I don't see the point of further existence, I tried to kill myself 2 times. <methods of suicide - ed. mod.>",
1,Good evening! I would like to ask for advice.,
1,"Kind people, I beg you to help. The situation is as follows. I am 30 years old. I have a husband and a child of 2 years old. 1.5 years ago we bought an apartment in a new building. And they moved to live with her husband in a family. This is essentially a communal apartment. All this time my husband mocked me in every possible way. He humiliated, insulted, he shouted obscenities at me every day. Tears daily. Nervous breakdowns. Never helped with a child. Recently, out of despair and pain, I began to apply to alcohol, and in large quantities, when the child is asleep. There was a great desire to get a divorce and forget this whole nightmare. We look like a very prosperous family. Everything is. Car, money. And now a week ago I find out that I am pregnant with my second child! (In 2016, I had an ectopic pregnancy and had a tube removed.) Good people, I don't want to have a second child. I'm so nervous and I don't know what to do. I can not quit smoking. Although I already feel guilty. I know that I will always be alone! I have no relatives. And my husband disgusts me even more. What to do. I don't want to live",
1,"I have long wanted to die. The thing is, I'm a failure. I am a disabled child. I didn't have friends and a boyfriend. There will never be children. Of course, my mother will worry, but the fact is that she herself is partly to blame for my illness. True, she always says that I blame her for all mortal sins, but believe me, this is not so. I also thought that it would be easier for her without me, although of course I do not want to commit suicide for this reason. It's just too late to change anything.",
1,"In the beginning, my life was very good, I lived in the Dnepropetrovsk region, was an excellent student, pleased my parents, attended English courses, studied vocals and was a purposeful child from birth. Further in my life, a disaster struck, my father died and I was left alone with my older sister and mother. We went to church since childhood, always believed in God, so from birth I had the right concepts. Soon we moved to Kiev, because my mother went to serve in the church and to help serve people. After my move to the capital, I had a difficult time. Helping others, my mother stopped understanding me and believes that my financial security is a manifestation of her love for me. When I began to grow up and see different people in the church, their attitude towards me, I decided to leave it and not go there. Perhaps this is the wrong choice, but at that time I did not see any other way out, since there was always a lot of aggression in my direction and a bad opinion about me. After that, my life completely turned upside down. From the impetuous child who achieved everything and had a definite goal to achieve something, not a trace remained. I started smoking, a lot of changes came into my life, parties, partying, soft drugs, there were guys. And this time lasted about six months. Then I realized everything, I decided that it was a weakness, because before everything was forbidden for me and when I felt freedom, I just gave free rein to everything. I decided to change, I no longer go to parties, I don’t hang out with guys, the only thing that I have not quit smoking. But now I feel even worse, weeks earlier. Now I am in grade 11, I know what to do, to take exams, what I need to take care of myself, go to the gym, but I cannot cope with myself. I feel empty inside, and I know that no one can help me like myself. I see that everyone thinks only of themselves, uses you only for their own purposes, and does not think about anything else. Mom loves me, I know that, she tries as best she can for me, but she still can't understand how hard it is for me now, and she just takes offense for my constant absence from school. Now, I see that I have no goal, no aspiration, I do not study at all, but time does not wait, it flies at the speed of light, but I remain in place. And a little more and I'll just break. And I cannot achieve anything in this life. Sometimes I think why I should live like this or why it happens to me. I know that with a strong desire, my problems can be solved, but the fact of the matter is that I have no strength left at all, laziness overcame me and I just remained as one warrior in the field.",
1,"I am 25 years old. Married. I live in depression. When I met my husband, he cheated, we broke up, but then we started dating again, he sometimes, or maybe did not stop, communicated with that woman. I thought I could forget and forgive, I married him. And now I regret it very much, it seems to me all the time that he is lying, the insult does not go away, I am very tired. Sometimes I don't want to live at all. Constantly bad thoughts in my head, thoughts of suicide constantly come. Help deal with depression. There is absolutely no strength and desire to live. From a girl who enjoyed life, I turned into a cloud. I can’t look in the mirror, it’s disgusting to see someone like that.",
1,"I can't get out of the situation, I'm confused. I think the whole fate of a person depends only on the family in which he was born. all social (love and trust in the family) behavioral skills (how mom and dad behave, what is good and what is bad) are formed only there, aspirations, desires, goals, to understand what you want (parents send you to a good school, carry you are everywhere, you travel, they show you everything so that you can see and learn more, they enroll in different circles, sections, in general they are engaged in you), you grow up with good self-esteem and choose the same social circle, you form such an environment around you in the form good, kind people.",

At the age of 5, I had to grow up, because another brother was born a year later, dad left to work. Parents constantly fought over the phone, and when dad came, it was terrible. I have never been close with my parents, they did not talk about anything important with me, I don’t remember anyone ever saying that they loved me, that I’m not an empty place. I've always wanted them to get divorced. And it happened a year ago, but I found out about it by chance, they still haven't told me and still live together, but I can no longer listen to everyday quarrels. Last year, I moved to a new school, and it turned out that I have no friends, everyone was just pretending, even though there were three of them, but I really miss. I have never had a best friend, not even just friends I could trust. Because of this, I constantly keep everything to myself, this is the first time I dared to speak out. I have a terrible character, I am very modest, kind, I cannot refuse anything, I study well, I have always been an exemplary child, I obeyed my parents, but what did this lead to? I have no friends, I can't find new ones, because I'm bored with me, there are many complexes, because of this I start to hate myself more and more.

I am nothing. It hurts me a lot because I am like that, and even if I was transported into the past, I would not change anything ... to love ... In short, I hate all of myself.

As a result, the very desire to get in touch disappears. And since I live in society, study at the university, every day for me is a series of humiliation and suffering. Around me, everyone communicates completely on any topic, they have fun, they gather, and I am like a white crow. For a long time they used to make fun of me in different groups, but now they just look at me with mute sympathy, as if I were sick. I can't understand why I need it.

1,"I want to die since the age of 9. There are many reasons to go crazy. The younger brother is disabled, I feel my mother's pain, today I read her a poem about how a woman had to get out of a difficult situation, rejected by her husband because of a disabled child, because she did not abandon the child so she cried so that my heart broke, my older brother is also trying to get out of poverty. And at 17 (2 years ago) I became a victim of rape. The case was refused because there are no witnesses (just extra work to the investigation) They said that you did not really resist. The first time I got drunk, and the second time, yes, I got cold feet. I was scared that they would kill me. Yes, that would be. Now I'm looking for help I went to the pstchologists, but in the Altai Territory, no one really cares, they just closed the case and everything and psychologists did the same. They are good for me that they didn’t die and that’s all. Half a year passed and I started hallucinations and panic attacks, something like attacks of fear and some other sleep paralysis. I wake up at night and I can’t say or move something and I don’t know how long is it It happened twice, as if I was in a coffin and could not do anything, and at the same time there was enormous panic and fear.

1,"I do not know what to do. I don’t want to die, but I don’t manage to live further. It all started in childhood. The first time I wanted to die while still very young, when I messed up something and didn't know how to tell my mother. I was always afraid of her disapproval. I was a very complex child and very ""correct"". I lacked love and attention, I remember constant criticism and fear ... fear of disappointing someone. My best friend was commanding me, I was a weak-willed scary girlfriend. But one day I put her in her place. The struggle began. We no longer spoke, we fought with my mother because of my rebellious behavior. I no longer gave myself command, but it all brought me a lot of pain. I cried almost every night. Plus, then there was a relationship, and therefore parting with problems. At the age of 15, for some reason I began to panic fear of death. My father started drinking heavily. It was a hell that does not end to this day. I lost a lot of weight, but I realized that the attitude of others did not change. Uncertainty followed me. By the end of school, stress began due to admission, then my mother went to the hospital. I got very fat, but I had a beloved boyfriend with whom we were together for 4 years, and it seemed to me that I finally accepted myself for who I am. The last straw was the university. In it, I feel worthless and stupid, I am terrified of everything, I can't do anything. I entered there for the company with a guy. Mom was against me leaving. It is the third year of torture, I am on the verge of expulsion. But it's not that. During these two years my beloved grandmother died in my arms, my mother was once again in the hospital with an operation, my father was drinking. With the guy, nothing came of it, I left him. He was glad of this, TK did not find the courage to leave himself. All this greatly affected my health and psyche, and I have always been emotional and impressionable. And I know that everything can be dealt with. I say this to other people, I never cry in front of someone, I try to smile and be happy, but I can't. Previously, panic, fear and pain rolled over from time to time. Then more often. Then more often. I just endured. Now I feel bad every day. The fear doesn't go away. I have been crying for several days. I know that everything can be dealt with, but I have almost no desire and no strength left at all. Yesterday I thought dying was the best way. I was not afraid. Rather, even relief. I only feel sorry for my loved ones. But I really love life. I love nature. I know how to enjoy it. But now I don't feel anything. It is difficult for me to breathe and is constantly scared, if it lets go, then not for long. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. What should I do, what will be better. I think I’m exhausted, broke, and this is the end. I have no one to help. For mom, this is a bad mood, and I don't want to involve my friend in this.

They searched the house and left behind. I did not do anything illegal ! Relatives turned away, they consider me a militant, and those whom I considered friends are now my enemies. Life has become difficult: in every person I see a snitch, and a traitor, I parted with my fiancee with a scandal. I burned all my photos and left social networks. And messengers. I became withdrawn, and overly cautious, I think I will change jobs. There are only 3 FRIENDS left. Mom is against me, she says nasty things when I meet, but I keep quiet,. Self-esteem has dropped dramatically, although I graduated from the university with a red diploma, I speak fluent Russian, Uzbek Turkmen, Dari, Pashtu, Urdu, Balochi, and Arabic languages. There are no problems with money. It is probably better to die than to live like this when I see enemies, traitors, and informers in my neighbors and colleagues.

But I, like any other child, forgave him (fun fact, at that time I began to think about death and its effectiveness). A year and a half pass. The father frames himself, but not for long. Here's me 12. Father starts drinking again; everything goes in a circle, new items are added: suicide attempts, yes, they were even when I was 9 (he drank when I was 7, or is it just the time that I remember), but then I did not think that he would repeat this is. The brightest attempt, then I had a strong hysterics, and the beginning of my hysterics, in principle, after that period I had some mental breakdowns, maybe I'll tell you about them later. 13 years old. He stopped drinking, I forgave him, but now, my psyche did not want to forgive me. In that very period I had everything: hysterics to self-mutilation under a state of passion after hysteria. For everything I am wildly ashamed, but for some reason I associate it with this. Now I'm 15. He stopped drinking 2 years ago, like what's wrong? He turned into ***. Earlier, having sobered up, he was good, but now, alas, I do not see anything in him.

I think about death, but I cannot commit suicide because I am afraid for my parents. They already feel bad. Black line. They say that I have to study and get good money, because my dad has no health, it’s already hard for him. I really don't want any of this, selfish, but I understand everything perfectly. I went through bulimia myself and this weight loss, which almost came down to anorexia. I have dysmorphia. I made all these diagnoses myself. Mom says it's self-hypnosis. I say that I am mentally ill, because after losing weight, a lot has changed. My life. Health, thoughts. Now I have typed again, a lot ... Mom says that I am lazy, that's all, and I come up with all this, looking for an easy life. This is partly true, I did not expect that life is very difficult. I'm weak. But on the other hand, after losing weight or during it, I changed a lot. I cry, I cut myself, I think about death, I want nothing. Sometimes I even think that I'm really a boy.

1,"Всем добрый день! С детства крутятся мысли о самоубийстве. Сейчас мне 30 и не проходило и дня, чтобы я не думала о том, как покончить со своей жизнью. Все началось со школы. Когда меня просто гнобили мои одноклассники и делали все, чтоб я чувствовала себя самой  уродливой и самой гнилой неудачницей. Так говорила и моя сестра младшая обо мне, мои ровесники. Мама тогда пила много, водила разных мужиков домой, надеясь выйти замуж. Росла в основном с бабушкой. Потом начали переезжать и так я проучилась в пяти разных школах. Дедушка тоже много пил и срывался на всех. Папы у меня никогда не было. Потом меня забрала тетя родная. Но она тоже оказалась не подарок. Все-таки не родная дочь я ей, и все больше я замыкалась в себе. В семье были большие проблемы. Но я все же старалась учиться и строила планы на будущее. Так я боролась с плохими мыслями. Поступила в ин.яз. Училась прилежно. Но на 3 курсе одна преподовательница просто меня завалила. Хоть я и сдавала все сессии на 4 и 5, но она даже на пересдачах меня никак не хотела даже 3 поставить. Так я начала курить. Родители не знали что делать и я решила уехать в другой город поближе к родителям (они живут в деревне). Тетя родная тоже уехала в этот же город и снимала квартиру. Я опять же жила с ней. Мама начала жить с одним мужиком и меньше начала выпивать. Я поступила заочно в университет иностр.языков, устроилась на работу в кафе и ходила еще на курсы ин.яз., чтобы улучшать свои навыки. Но потом у тети начались проблемы и она меня выгнала. Ночью с вещами я поехала к троюр. сестре. И мама мне звонила очень редко, в основном баба переживала за меня. За 3 года я отучилась в университете, успешно закончила 5 курс. Но побоялась сдавать гос.экзамены. Я не уверена была в своих силах и хотела ехать в Лондон, учиться англ.языку. Но поездку потом пришлось отменить. У мамы был большой кредит и нужно было как то помогать. Так в скором времени я уехала жить в деревню. Она уже разошлась с тем мужиком. И сижу я в деревне, работала удаленно. Тетя эта, кстати, теперь тоже живет в деревне. Живут мама, баба, деда, тетя и я. Я бы снова уехала бы в город, но за бабой и дедой некому смотреть. Мама на работе, часто гуляет. Тетя поздно приходит с работы. Деда если выпьет, то может упасть где-нибудь во дворе. Баба тоже уже старенькая. Все мои подруги замужем, есть дети. Недавно накопила 250 тыс.руб. Потратила все на благоустройство родительского дома. Вещей себе уже сто лет не покупала, потому что жалко денег. На работу никто не берет, потому что нет высш.образования. Рабочим надо платить, а у меня ни копейки в кармане. На работу доА я как старая дева сижу в деревянной клетке. Доллжна была сегодня собеседование пройти, мама планшет не дала (там через скайп). Просто потому что у нее там игры. Дед через день орет дома. И самое худшее, что может произойти со мной - это либо я начну пить или покончу жизнь самоубийством. Я пока держусь. Плачу конечно каждый день. Стараюсь жить лучше, но ничего не получается. Видимо не зря меня называли неудачницей. Но все равно семью свою люблю. Это пришло ко мне со временем. Хоть и наплевательское отношение у них ко мне. Если можно с кем-то пообщаться, я с удовольствием. Может хоть как то поддержим друг друга.",

I am sick because subconsciously I do not want to go there. I constantly think what people think of me, I'm terribly jealous of their opinions. I don't know who I should be. My parents love me, but they don't understand how hard it is for me. They think my experiences are funny. Especially dad. Of course they are funny, but it doesn't make me feel better. I feel like I'm a sociopath. I'd rather sit at home than go to a noisy social circle. I wanted to transfer to home schooling, but I understand that I will have to study the subjects I hate even harder. I tried to find a “core” subject, but I can neither write essays nor solve problems. I understand that the problem is with me. I envy people who look at problems easily. But I can't do that. I'm too vulnerable. I'm already thinking of finishing school, and then going to courses and working as a hairdresser or someone else. I really care about every little thing. And for all this, I hate myself. I can not do it anymore. I have no strength. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I am afraid not to live up to the expectations of my parents (dad), they of course say that anyone loves me, but sometimes words slip from dad's side that you will feed my mom and me in old age. Of course, not so openly, but the meaning is the same. I'm afraid of life. I'm afraid of everything. I'm afraid that now I am worried, and then I will become seriously ill. I have no friends. There is one friend, but we rarely communicate with her. I have already changed 2 schools. And of course the problem is me.",

1,"Здравствуйте. Прочитала я много историй на этом сайте. Еще больше убедилась, что у людей проблемы бывают серьезнее моих, от этого чувствую себя еще большим ничтожеством. У меня любящие родители, меня не обижали никогда. Только из-за их любви я еще и не сделала этот страшный шаг. Но будущее меня так страшит. Я несколько раз пробовала изменить свою жизнь. Меняла место работы и профессию, но так и не достигла ничего. Только ошибок кругом понаделала. Стоит мне понять, что я ошиблась в своей работе (какими бы последствия ни были: минимальными или действительно серьезными), я впадаю в панику, даже в ужас. Я просто умираю в душе. У меня начитаются частые панические атаки. Я постоянно плачу, не могу есть, не могу спать. Мама говорит, что я слишком зациклена на работе, что не это главное в жизни. И я ее понимаю, но для меня всегда было очень важно стать для нее и дедушке с бабушкой достойной опорой и поддержкой. И вот, я понимаю, что я никогда не оправдаю их надежд. Мне просто хочется умереть. Но я этого не сделаю, т.к. не хочу причинять им боль. Я читала тут на сайте письмо матери, которая потеряла своего ребенка. И я не могу так поступить со своими близкими. Я горстями пью успокоительное и оно уже перестает помогать. Я понимаю, что действительно большой проблемы у меня нет, чтобы идти к психиатру, но просто психолог мне не помогает (сменила многих).  Хочу просто отключить все эмоции и чувства. Не хочу вообще что-либо испытывать. Моя подруга заканчивает учится на психиатра, она догадывается, что со мной что-то не так. Она говорила мне, что скорее всего мне нужно медикоментозное лечение, но я боюсь, что там обо мне подумают. Я вообще зависима от чужого мнения. Я всегда боюсь кого-то подвести или не оправдать ожиданий. Я пробовала бороться с собой, но уже устала. Вообще думаю о смерти лет с 12. Чем старше, тем чаще и глубже об этом задумываюсь. Несколько раз теряла работу от своей тупости. Делала ошибки. Я впадаю в ступор и затем панику, если на меня начать ругаться. Не выношу криков. Понимаю, что со всеми моими тараканами в голове, мне никогда не найти нормальную работу. Главная мечта в жизни стабильная работа (я не гонюсь за большими деньгами) и спокойствие. Я не хочу даже заводить семью, потому что противоположный пол пугает, а детям я не смогу ничего дать ни в материальном, ни в духовном смысле. Вот спрашивается, зачем такому биомусору как я вообще жить? Я держусь только за маму с дедушкой и бабушкой. Перед мамой только пару недель как показала часть своих чувств и мыслей. Теперь мне так стыдно перед ней. Она ведь переживает и старается как-то меня подбодрить, а мне все труднее делать хорошую мину при плохой игре. Перед дедушкой и бабушкой вообще делаю вид, что все замечательно. Они старенькие и им эти волнения не на пользу. Мне страшно жить. Я слишком тупая для этой жизни. Хожу в церковь, молюсь, но так паршиво на душе, когда прошу Господа Бога за себя. Я такая эгоистка. Я у мамы единственный ребенок, поэтому иногда жалею, что у меня нет брата или сестры. Так бы она не осталась одна. Мама часто говорит, что я все ее жизнь. Как же мне ее жаль, что ей досталась такая жалкая и недостойная ее дочь. От самой себя мерзко.",

This only makes it worse, a couple of times I was on the verge, I almost did what I intended. When I want to explain something in tears, he yells at me even more .. I love him very much, but I'm afraid that soon I will not be able to overcome my thoughts and do it ... I have no friends, I have parents, but I cannot tell all ... the martyr does not understand me .. thoughts of suicide do not leave me, it seems to me that he does not need me ...",

Recently I left my beloved man, afraid to send life to him with my presence, but this smeared me even more. I never liked to spend time in society, it always seemed to me that I was an object of ridicule, contempt, albeit for the eyes. For being empty. Now the desire for isolation is growing. It was not always smooth with my family, but now I only have aggression, dull despair, not a drop of remorse for my behavior towards them. I don't want to live, and do I live at all. It is not clear to me. One gets the impression that my emptiness coincides with the emptiness of death and this is the only way out.

Until the very last moment I believed that now everything would be refuted, but no ...

I am afraid that I will never get pregnant again (before that it was not possible for 2 years). I'm afraid that my relationship with my husband will deteriorate, although he was very supportive of me, and now we have somehow moved away. Why does he need me this, I can't give birth to a child?

1,"! Thinking about suicide. This is the fault of my mother and sister. We used to live happily. There were of course petty family quarrels, but they all have. After my father's death, I became lonely. I was very close to my dad. He was a support for me, I felt like a client behind a strong wall. But God took him away from us. And we tried to live as before. And it seemed to me that it worked. But for the last two weeks, I have no meaning in life. I am morally pressured by my family, this is my mother and sister. I'm ready for anything for them. I love them very much (maybe I already loved them). Since I do not know if I will love as before .. Sis, the reasons for all the quarrels. Mom loves her very much. It hurts me to watch when, after quarrels, they sit in another room and have fun, my mother smiles and pampers her, and I sit in the other one .. cry and think about everything .. It’s hard to offend a stranger, but when my relatives hurt it very much. My little sister stopped respecting me, before, when the little one obeyed, supported me. And right now, if that immediately to mom. Mom of course listens to her. I always try to find a common language. After every quarrel, I start talking, if yes, I’m not to blame. I have friends, but I'm not that kind of person who cries about my problems and clogs another person's brain. I only share with my mom and sister. There were just such moments, but tomorrow we measured and loved each other, but these two weeks are not like that. The day before yesterday they seemed to be reconciled, and today they quarreled. For two weeks now I have been sitting apart from them. The little sister does not talk to me at all on her own, I force her to communicate, I myself start a conversation such as learning, what's new, etc. She more or less opens up before my mother's arrival, then again something goes wrong and we quarrel. Who's to blame I'm to blame. I ask my mother that you don't scold her at all, why only me. She is silent in response or shuts her mouth (not in the literal sense, she just says that's enough, be quiet) ... I don't know what to do, there is no point in living at all.

And it seems to me, they did not love. My father left us when I was born. And my mother took it out on me. I was basically a calm child, I read almost all the time ... I studied well. Then in high school there was an aggravation of panic attacks and agoraphobia ... I could not even go to school. Then he let go. At the age of 18, she left her parents. To the future husband. She gave birth to a son. 9 years ago. I immediately began a terrible aggravation of everything. Which continues to this day. Only it got worse and worse. Now I can no longer live without pills - concor for tachycardia ... phenazepam for fear. Cetrin for urticaria - every day. If I don't drink all the skin is torn. The reason was not found. We parted with my husband several times. Since I'm hysterical. And I don't know how to live in a family without quarrels. This is evident from childhood ... But I try ... study. Thanks to my husband for being with me. I am a very difficult person. I scream .... often aggression. Sometimes I act like a child. Psychotherapists, psychologists and other doctors cannot help me. Half a year ago I got pregnant with my second child .... but unfortunately panic attacks and neurosis hit me with such force. That I could not stand it and drank pills. The doctors said to have an abortion. Half a year later is at the moment. I decided to try again. Either now or never I thought. Years go by. And she got pregnant again ... I thought it would be better. But no. Now 4 weeks of ber. Panic attacks and neurosis and all the symptoms that can be aggravated. Pulse jumps to 170. Pressure too. The fear is terrible. I am afraid of tachycardia. To the horror. I continue to drink concor even with anaprilin attack. This is a risk for the child. The husband generally says all this at the wrong time. No money, etc. ... no apartment ... no car. I don't work .... Yes, I agree. But what to do now. I can not. I no longer have the strength ... thoughts are bad. Everything hurts. The panics are terrible. The ambulance doesn't take me seriously. Doctors can do nothing. Now I think on such stresses and pills ... why did I get pregnant ... I'm crying. I so want a second child.

Then he served in the army, where he was a gun commander with the rank of sergeant. A month after military service, I got a job, where I wore a shirt and did not lift a hand heavier, and immediately entered the academy for a correspondence course. Then a year later he took an apartment in Astrakhan on a mortgage without interest and bought a good foreign car. At the same time he was engaged in trade. Things were going very well, my friends and relatives were proud of me that I achieve everything myself. All this time I loved one girl. She was married and has a child. We met in secret. 2 years ago I told my parents that I love her and want to be with her. They were against it, but I insisted on it. And then he transferred to Astrakhan for his own work. We lived with her in her apartment, and they rented mine. We went to rest abroad and to our seas, in a word we lived happily. But things did not go well, I took another loan. A year ago, my parents played us a wedding, began to communicate very well with her parents, I am very attached to the child, and he to me. It seems that everyone loved each other. At our wedding, 100 people were poisoned, the glory of God cost a maximum of weeks in the hospital. The fifth and sixth years at the academy were transferred to Moscow, and there the prices were ""space"". Financial difficulties set in. My wife paid for her mortgage herself and for the car loan for her car, which she took before the wedding. As a result, this year I took an academic leave in my last year, put my parents on loans, I myself was mired in them, in debt and even in microfinance.

Naturally, I had no friends then, because I just sat at home and could not go anywhere. Then I went to school and realized that I could not establish contact with my peers, but over time everything seemed to be getting better, I began to have ""friends"" who, as it turned out, just wanted to cheat my homework or play with me on the phone simply because that they were bored. Nobody called me and still does not call me. Nobody invites anywhere and is unlikely to invite. I will continue further all finished 9 classes, these ""friends"" ran away from me, but I had one friend as it seemed to me a real one, we communicated well with him, but this was only limited by the school. And so we finished school, and everyone again scattered in all directions, I lost touch with him and the other day I tried to restore it, but it seems to me that he no longer cares about me, and he is full of his own problems. Here in the 11th grade I had love, but not mutual, I got angry with myself and this girl, I said such nasty things to her, which I really regret and I am ashamed of myself. I entered the university, I got a friend there, but he was from another city and now he went there. We again communicated with him only within the framework of the university, he even tried to invite me somewhere, but for some reason they couldn't get me out of the house. The girls began to show interest in me, but everything ended in nothing, because I either did not like her, or I did not know how to approach her, and if they did, they quickly sewed me off. I graduated from university, entered the magistracy, went to work. At work, a boring team of women, I'm a guy, there is nothing to talk about: everyone has children, cats, dogs, all talk about this. While I was at the last session in the magistracy, I was pulled by the ears by a girl with whom I had studied before and who, by the way, showed interest in me, to take a walk to celebrate my admission with her group. I felt like a third person there, everyone was having fun, but I didn't know where to stick myself, I don't even know what to talk about with this girl. As a result, this girl has a fiancé, she will soon be married, all my classmates are with girls, and classmates will soon be married. And I am still alone, everyone has betrayed me, nobody needs me, I am stuck in my four walls, I cannot talk to people, although I really want to, because something is bothering me. I became angry and I vent my anger at my family, it seems to me that my life is meaningless. Help, I don't want to live like this.",

Her elderly husband turned out to be a pedophile. I was little then and did not understand that something terrible and wrong was happening. For this she did not say anything to anyone.

1,", my name is Eugene, I am 15 years old and I don’t want to live anymore, because I’m tired of being constantly offended by everyone (classmates). I am easily driven to suicide. I take offense at the words ""No"" and ""You can't"", especially ""You can't"" as I hear, I want to hang myself right away. Why live if everything is impossible so let me die and this will not happen in the next world. I don’t understand for what purpose one must live, why live and I don’t have to live anyway, no one loves me and everyone hates me. Why live if you die anyway? What is the meaning of life and is it worth living for me on. A few days ago I was at school, as the lessons ended, I quickly went home to hang myself, and my parents were at home, so I put it aside.

1," everyone! I have such a story, I have real loneliness and I am so tired of this life. I am writing because I want to speak out. I am 34 years old, I have a daughter, a job, etc. It so happened that my daughter lives with my mother, I live in another city (450 km. From them). I have a man who seems to be not bad. But I am lonely, I do not feel life in me, I live on autopilot, I work because I need money to live (I rent an apartment), I have acquaintances, but no friends (I don’t need it). My man, just yesterday, made it clear that he would not have a family with him, I was like a transshipment option for him (we have been living for 2 years together). He didn’t say so directly, but the conversation was about “I’m already old (40 years old), I don’t need young ones, only old women shine for me, and old women already have children, but I realized that I was not ready to live with a woman and her a child as a family (he has children from different marriages, he was married three times), but he also wants his own child. ""From this conversation, I realized that I had to"" turn over ""for him. What the heck? Sorry . Why ... I never came across a normal man, I met this one, I thought ""Well, finally ..."", but no, it was not there))). I don’t suffer, no, it doesn’t hurt me, I’m just now sure that I’m not needed here, a failure of the system, an error ... I have a void inside, there’s nothing, no emotions. You will say that your daughter ... I will not say that I do not love her, I love her, I love her very much, but I am no mother, I can not give anything to the child, I’m scanty, barely enough to survive, I don’t have my own home. and it will never be (I really look at life), I definitely can't make money, I can't get an ipoptek either, I don't work officially, the residence permit is temporary (by coincidence, I can't register anywhere, long history, it takes a long time to explain why ), well, I have nowhere to register, of the relatives only my mother and stepfather, with whom we have no relationship, in general, we hate each other, my mother is forbidden to let me on the doorstep. I'm not scary, pretty pretty, slender, tall, not stupid, but ""not alive"". There was a sea of ​​betrayal, starting with my mother ... I don't take offense at her, it's just that she is ... So, I don't know what to do with myself, I don't know ... how to find interest in life? How to find yourself? The feeling that I died, only the body exists, and the soul died, I repeat once again, there are no emotions, there is no joy or sadness, I do not feel anything (it was not always like this), I used to be a very emotional person, I suffered a lot, cried, I admired a lot, rejoiced a lot, and now NOTHING.

1,", I need help very urgently. I do not think at all about the consequences of my actions. And my actions are VERY bad. Somewhere in the fifth grade, I began to have a tendency towards cruelty. Then I suggested to my friend that we become gopniks. She agreed. They want to kick me out of school, because I almost strangled a third grader, tried to rob him and stole some candy from a classmate. Ideas often appear to commit suicide. But the worst thing is that before I just cried and thought to commit suicide and not suffer, but this time I noticed that I am more confident that this is a good way out. I'm trying to convince myself that everything is still not so bad, but I think soon the madness will take up. I just do something and do not think why, and why I am doing it. Am I out of my mind?

1,"здравсвуйте всем.. Мне 26 лет, девушка.. пишу сюда в надежде хоть здесь найти душевный отклик... уже второй или третий месяц нахожусь в критическом состоянии.. от меня ушел любимый человек, с которым я провела 8 лет своей жизни... ушел во второй раз.. первый раз на втором году отношений изменил мне, на стороне родился ребёнок, о чем я узнала лишь спустя год.. по этой причине был его первый уход-муки совести и невозможность при таких обстоятельствах быть вместе.. но получается, она ходила беременная 9 месяцев, а я была ни сном ни духом, делила с ним постель, простила измену.. не суть.. 2 года он гулял, искал себя, как я понимаю пытался строить дичную жизнь и даже жил с НЕЙ месяц.. только вот почему то она ушла от него, сбежала.. каким то образом спустя эти 2 года мы сошлись вновь.. я даже не поняла как это произошло.. цветы.. подарки.. и вот мы живем вместе.. первый раз за 6, на тот момент лет.. год живем.. делаем ремонт.. пытаемся ужиться в быту.. ездим отдыхать.. обычные отношения..он делает мне предложение на 7 ой год отношений со словами ""я очень долго думал и решил"". я соглашаюсь.  каждый день думаю о его дочери.. и плачу.. забыла сказать, что на 2 ом году отношений я следала от него аборт, ибо ""КАКОЙ ИЗ МЕНЯ ОТЕЦ""(что не помешало ему стать отцом через год после этого..). Все то время, пока мы живем вместе, он твердит мне, что я не такая, здесь не то, ни к чему не стремлюсь, работа у меня тупая, я деградирую, что у всех вот так, а у нас нет. хотя материально я никогда от него не зависела, ничего не просила.. не соответствую я его ожиданиям, его идеальной картинке. убираюсь плохо, готовлю редко.. Не мотивирую и не поддерживаю, хотя я старалась как могла..У него своя фирма, если это имеет значение.. к свадьбе мы не идем, дальше предложения не зашло. Он открыл нам магазинчик, который в итоге не стал приносить прибыль и через полгода я предложила его продать, пока не поздно, чтоб вернуть ему хоть какие то деньги.. занималась этим магазином я и поняла, что я больше не хочу этим заниматься и заставлять себя. Мне все время казалось, что он мой начальник, постоянные указания, тычки носом.. Крики за опоздания, хотя даже по документам все оформила на себя.. Как только он понял, что я не шучу, имею свое мнение и не желаю идти на компромисс, он берет ПАУЗУ  и уезжает жить отдельно, что конечно же было не раз за 8 лет и я не придала этому значения.. думала успокоится, пройдем очередной кризис и все.. Нет.. за то время, пока он жил отдельно, магазин продался. Я осталась без средств к существованию, но это исключительно мои проблемы, так как общего бюджета у нас на было НИКОГДА, а жили то на мои то на его. Только никогда я подумать не могла, что человек может оставить меня во второй раз. не в средствах дело.. как только я поняла, что он не вернется..у меня сдали нервы.. я не узнавала себя..у меня начались панические атаки, я болялась выйти из дома.. Я смотрела в зеркало и не узнавала свое отражение. Все как во сне. Ни одной эмоции в душе. Я не могла сходитьв душ, сделать элементарные вещи, потому что мой мозг просто не хотел меня слушать..Я не знаю как все это обьяснить. Аппогеем всего стал день, когда я молча сидела на кухне, а он собирал вещи. Собрал и ушел. На следующий день я пришла домой и не осталось ничего от него, пока я была на работе он забрал телевизор и остатки своей одежды.. я не ела неделю, я не могла.С тех пор мой мозг будто заблокировал все процессы.. Меня третий месяц мучает непостижимое мне чувство вины.. Перед всеми.. Мна кажется что я виновата перед всеми.. это ощущается на физическом уровне.. Я не вижу своего будущего..Я не знаю зачем мне работать, зачем мне деньги.. Зачем мне кушать и что либо делать.. Покажется наверно все это ерундой.. Но будто во мне черная дыра .. у меня постоянное чувство деперсонализации и дереализации.. Я сравниваю себя со всеми, сситаю себя никчкмной, ничего не добившейся, и не вижу смысла ничего добиваться.. мне кажется я ничего не могу дать окружающим, даже в плане просто общения.. хотя всегда слыла интересным человеком.. Я ненавижу себя.. ненавижу.. за что я могу себя любить если человек ушел от меня ДВАЖДЫ? даже не смотря на мое прощение, смирение.. каждый вечер я надеюсь не проснуться. я не могу простить. я виню во всем себя. я ненавижу себя. в тайне надеясь что он вернется. с другими мужчинами избегаю общения, потому что чувствую что пуста.. мне нечего отдать эмоционально.. боюсь показаться неинтересной.. мне кажется он меня просто сломал...я не знаю как жить и зачем.. я доверилась во второй раз и снова зря.. я хочу пойти к психиатру, но чувствую что кроме себя самой не поможет никто.. но сама я не справляюсь.. невыносимо жить.. не видя смысла.. весь смысл был в нем.. я ходила в церковь, просила Господа помочь простить.. и дать сил жить.. но их нет.. и каждый вечер в течение 3 месяцев я буквально ложусь и сворачиваюсь, чтобы не повеситься.. то ли надеясь, что не проснусь, то ли на на то, что утром полегчает..этот человек об этом знает, о моем состоянии..ему плевать.. я не знаю как найти силы двигаться дальше.. простить себя и его.. ведь люди не уходят оттуда, где хорошо.. но я считаю себя теперь ничтожеством.. никому не нужной и неинтересной.. раз ничего так и не получилось.. разбилась моя мечта о семье.. о детях с ним.. все планы были связаны с ним..простите за весь этот сумбур..буду рада хотя бы паре слов .. если кто то откликнется..",

In connection with this problem, we are giving the dogs with whom I have lived for 3 years. It's hard to deal with it, but I'm holding on.",
1,". My name is Lyosha, I'm 13 years old. My mother died 6 years ago, so my father and older brother (brother is 16 years old) are engaged in my upbringing. I study poorly, only fours and threes. Today I got a deuce. She's not my first, because I know what I will get for it. I am very afraid to tell my dad, because he will always take and whip me. My brother will also take the belt, you see, his dad allowed me to punish. I do not know what to do. After all, because of this little deuce, shouting, obscenities, insults and beatings will begin. I can't sit normally, so I also got a deuce. Please tell me what should I do?",
1,"На данный момент мне 25 лет. Начну с самого детства, в детском саду писался во сне (инурез продлился почти до самой армии, в 16-17 перестал) , все смеялись надо мной изза этого, в школе получал, не мог постоять за себя, учился с тройки на двойку (потому что рос с мамой которая работала чтоб прокормить нас и соответственно некому было следить за моей успеваемостью и воспитанием в общем) в институте прокчился три курса за деньги и то забил и перестал посещать (в итоге был отчислен) и не хочу снова туда возвращаться, отца не видел вообще за прожитую жизнь, первый сексуальный опыт был с мальчиком моего же возраста (лет в 14-16) боюсь это повлекло за собой огромный ряд психических проблем, всплывающих постепенно, т.к меня тянет и к девочкам и к мальчикам (мозги кипят от этого) лишний вес от которого не могу и не хочу избавиться до сих пор (т.к нет стимула и целей в жизни) в армии это был сущий ад для меня, подтянуться не мог и не могу по сей день, сверстники страдали изза меня (т.к коллективное наказание было) люлей выхватывал много раз по любой причине, чмырили меня часто, плакал изза этого много, тем подрывая еще больше свой ""авторитет"", казалось что 1 год это бесконечные страдания, маме звонил плакался что мне тут очень плохо, что меня тут убивают (хотя по факту всё терпимо было) просто когда тебя в прямом смысле ""отрывают от сиськи"" в 18 лет все кажется непреодолимым (100% получил моральных травм за время службы) много врал, попадался на этом, получал, все равно продолжал (до сих пор кажется что меня сглазили) на работе по началу все хорошо было, но потом скатился, взял кредит большой, который до сих пор погасить не могу (мама пока не знает об этом но боюсь если узнает, то ее приступ схватит), чуть не уволили (я остался на той же работе но получаю теперь намного меньше) эту работу с трудом нашел, а новую боюсь сил не хватит найти (очень сложно переношу смену обстановки) мне по душе больше скажем так ""однообразие"" когда ничего не происходит нового, если и так всё вроде бы ничего......друзей почти нет, а те что были сам ""растерял"" изза своего гнилого характера, как помощь мне нужна - буду на стены лезть и молить о пощаде, а как всё более менее стабилизируется, забываю про остальных, с женщиной первый секс был в 23-24 и то она меня старше на 12+ лет, сейчас я понимаю что  я такой никому не нужен, у меня куча комплексов и вредных привычек, никакая девушка не захочет жить со мной, каждый день все чаще думаю о смерти, но знаю что не смогу наложить на себя руки потому что тюфяк, я смотрю на других и плачу что у меня всё плохо в отличии от них, но в тоже время ничего не делаю и не хочу делать чтобы что то изменилось, спускаю всё на самотёк, я в замкнутом кругу нахожусь и меня разрывает от этого, я боюсь жить дальше (боюсь остаться на едине со своими проблемами и мыслями) особенно когда все знакомые исчезнут из моей жизни а мама умрёт прости господи за эти слова, мне кажется этот момент будет летальным для меня, т.к ВСЕ обязанности упадут на меня, а я тупо не знаю как с этим всем справится, никто уже не подскажет и тем более не поможет.....часто задаюсь вопросом зачем я такой родился? Какая у меня цель в жизни предназначена? И самый главный - за что такое наказание как я, моей маме которая так хотела ребёнка, которая билась как рыба об лед лишь бы сыночек жил в сухости тепле и сытости, а я даже не могу обнять ее и сказать я тебя люблю и по просить прощения за всё....очень часто плачу по этому поводу, плакать у меня лучше всего получается, не имею собственного мнения, суеверный, то верю в бога то нет, все эти мысли со временем затихают но потом раскрываются опять и с большей силой, всё идёт под откос, не знаю что вообще мне делать, просто плачу и думаю о том какая кара меня ждёт в дальнейшем за всё содеянное, чувствую себя полнейшим отбросом изза своего образа жизни, поплакаться некому, столко боли скопилось, знаю что загнию один без поддержки, с детства сижу за компьютером, люблю играть, потому что отвлекаюсь и забываю обо всех внешних реальных проблемах....в общем не знаю как дальше жить и как побороть себя, выбраться из замкнутого колеса которое уверенно катиться на самое дно, мне тошно от себя, осознавая какой я прогнивший...все 25 лет жизнь прогибала меня, преподнося всё новые и сложные испытания лично для меня, но я не становился сильнее а всё больше утопал в болоте собственных страхов и проблем, часть того чего хотелось бы высказать уже не вспомню, хотя хочется в полной мере и во всех красках рассказать о том что со мной твориться.... много чего произошло, мне просто страшно и одинокого, меня врят ли кто поймёт, постоянная смена настроения, накручивающиеся комом проблемы вгоняют меня в глубокую депрессию, я тупо запутался и не знаю как надо правильно жить...",
1,Hey.,
1, dear readers.,
1,"I want to die, I got tired of everything! This world is too hard for me, I can't cope with anything, neither with work nor with studies. In my personal life, too, everything is bad, the guy left after 3 years of relationship, I can not live calm now, the pain from this parting haunts me. How can you live in this world where everyone is using you, betraying, cheating? I already have no strength",
1,"Здравствуйте. Меня зовут Александр. Мне 23 года. У меня в настоящее время сложилась достаточно сложная ситуация. По крайней мере так кажется мне.. Дело в том что я суицидально настроенный человек. В последние 2 года я думаю о суициде буквально каждый день.. За эти два года в буквальном смысле не было не одного дня чтобы я об этом не думал. Дело в том ,что детство и последующее взросление у меня сложилось мягко говоря нелёгкое.. Я не хочу говорить обо всём ,но некоторые моменты я могу раскрыть. Я не помню моменты раньше 6ти летнего возраста. Поэтому буду говорить начиная с того возраста.. В детстве у меня были и мама и папа,но с ними я не жил. Они разошлись,когда мне было 5. Я жил у бабушки. Квартира бабушки находилась напротив их квартиры. Мать ушла жить к своей матери.. Оба моих родителей страдали(страдают) алкоголизмом. Вопросами моего существования занималась бабушка.Кормила бабушка,одежду тоже давала бабушка. Так как родители разошлись,отец остался жить напротив бабушки. Т.е рядом со мной. Отец мой -агрессивный человек. Вплоть до окончания школы,жизнь у меня была не сахар. Он избивал и бабушку и меня.. Прекратилось это когда мне исполнилось 14 и я мог дать сдачи.. в это же время мама у меня умерла от цироза. никакого расстройства я не испытал.. и если честно мне до сих пор всё равно. Отца своего я ненавижу.. А на мать мне всегда было плевать.Так как в детстве она не проявляла рвения со мной общаться. В школе я был изгоем. Меня обзывали ,избивали. Преподавателям было плевать.. Они никогда не пытались это поменять. А жаловаться я им не мог. Боялся что станет хуже.Хотя они и сами всё видели,но ничего не делали..Я живу в посёлке и поэтому все знали ,кто мои родители и видимо было предубеждение ,что я не лучше.. Отношение ко мне начало меняться только ,когда я был в старших классах. Жил я у Бабушки.Отношения с ней формальные. Семейных взаимоотношений никогда не было. Я жил в своём маленьком мире.. Друзей у меня не было. За всю жизнь ни одного. одиночество сильно давило.. Но в тоже время мне никто не был нужен.. В 15 лет была попытка суицида.. Я пытался её скрыть,но начались осложнения и на скорой я загремел в больницу,где с дуру, в конце концов признался в попытке суицида. Потом моего отца лиши Род прав. Опеку после долгих уговоров и определённых условий взяла бабушка.. Я не хотел в детский дом и предложил отдавать большую часть пособия бабушки,чтобы меня не сдали туда. Были и другие условия ,но это отдельная тема. В школе я доучился. Так как вся жизнь была каким то недрозумением,я никогда не думал о том что мне делать дальше.. не думал где я буду жить...ведь жилья у меня собственного не было) я поступил в университет. просто наугад. сиротский статус позволял поступить куда хочу.. но мне было плевать. Профессия мне не подходила.. учился с горем пополам. 2 года проучился и после нервного срыва угодил в больницу. в психиатрическую. Душевное или как говорят психологическое состояние после больницы ухудшилось в сотни раз.. таблетки смогли расшатать и так уже расшатанное.. В итоге я бросил учёбу и вернуться мне уже не удастся.. да я и не собираюсь. после того как бросил прошло 2 года.. год назад была попытка суицида. опять неудачная.. промучался я около месяца от последствий.. И СЕЙЧАС я понимаю.. детство у меня не сложилось.друзей у меня нет. мне без них плохо и в тоже время я не уверен что мне нужны люди. Мизантропия достигла пика. Каждый человек вызывает раздражение. даже тот кого я в первый раз вижу в окне. Семьи мне не видать.. да и скорее всего вряд ли это было бы возможно если бы у меня было всё хорошо.. Отношений у меня ни с кем не было.. да и вряд ли могли бы быть.. Дело в том что я человек с нетрадиционной ориентацией . На 100% я уверен быть в этом не могу.. но Я думаю что так и есть. А отношение общества к таким людям сложное. Также у меня нет жилья.. После того как я ушёл из университета живу я в социальном жилье. ноутбук полуразломанный... пользуюсь соседским вай фаем.. пока они не додумаются поставить пароль..Доходом у меня нет... я не работаю.. деньги трачу которые успел накопить пока считался сиротой и платили пособия.. Деньги скоро кончаться ..и тогда я окажусь на улице и без еды. Я страдаю крайней степенью социофобии.. С глазу на глаз я не умею ни с кем разговаривать. Я буквально боюсь людей и стараюсь к ним не подходить. на улицу тоже не выхожу.. Приступы паники и дрожи сильно мучают. головная боль не проходит месяцами. Врачей я не люблю. и к ним я не пойду. В больнице ставили диагнозы Соиальные фобии, пролонгированная депрессивная реакция с расстройство адаптации,писали Биполярное расстройство,расстройство личности смешанного типа. ",
1,"I am alone all the time, people avoid me. I am an outcast in my school. They gave me hope for a bright future and immediately took it away. All the brightest in me was destroyed. I was morally destroyed. I can no longer believe in friendship or love. For me there is no longer the concept of ""good"", there is only one evil and self-hatred. By my existence I spoil this world, I have no more place in it. What does one useless life in this world mean? It will be better if this all ends. The pain will stop. Death is the only way out",

1,"! I study in the 9th grade, I find it difficult to study. Dad always asks how I study, I have to lie, because once I got 2 and decided to tell my mom, she told dad, and he swore at me so much I was in shocked! I didn't want to come home. Every day I have thoughts to commit suicide or run away from home. All my relatives get me, all the time I have to adjust to their mood. It hurts me to hear how dad vouches for mom or sometimes hits. Everyone hates me, they complain about me, I am like a mockery to everyone, or I just interfere with their life",
1,"I am 18 years old and my hair fell out terribly. And this has been going on for almost a year, it happened due to strong prolonged stress and hormonal disruption (endocrine system disease), I feel lifeless, all my senses are dulled ... I cannot enjoy life, even when everything else is good. I don’t want anything, I don’t need anyone. And every day it’s harder. And it seems already ready to leave this world, I think about it every day ...",

After all, I'm not a fool .... I realize everything. But I cannot tell my heart not to love. Feelings tear me apart. It hurts wildly both mentally and physically. What to do .... the project is called - you will win .... but it seems that I was defeated .... I am dying ... holding on with my last bit of strength for the sake of the children. Is my whole life now a solid black stripe?",
1,I have a wonderful child,
1,", I don't know what to do. I want to commit suicide! I can't find a job. Today I spent my last money on bread, potatoes and pasta. I am 31 years old, I have a first grader son. There are many vacancies. But almost nothing suits me, because I live with my child alone. Because of the school and the fact that I have no one to help, I am very limited in my choice of work - I need a place from 9.00 to 17.00. And there are almost no such vacancies. Basically it is a 2/2 floating weekend. You can, of course, say that it would be good for me to find a nanny to take him to school and pick him up and sit with him while I am at work. But the prices for nannies are such that the entire salary will be spent on this with such a schedule. And finding some kind of grandmother for this is also not an option, because it is our pensioners who earn extra money, and their prices are not lower than the average in this area. The places that suit me according to the schedule are located in other parts of the city, where I simply won't physically be in time in the morning. And at the interview, first of all, they ask what I am going to do when my son is ill or on vacation. I agree to any job, even for a minimal payment, as long as there is something to buy food. But for two months now I have not been able to find anything. How can mothers live in this country? The ex-husband does not pay child support and does not help in any way. To get my son into first grade, I have not paid for the last few months for a room (we are renting in a hostel), now they are threatening to evict us if I don’t pay by Friday. I do not know what to do. I was looking for a part-time job on the Internet, but I have no IT skills. And everything else is most often a scam. I'm so desperate! I know that it is possible to send a child to an orphanage for a while (for six months), due to family difficulties, until I improve my financial situation. But then again, how do you explain this to a 7-year-old child? How to tell him about it? No matter how you explain it, it will still be a lifelong trauma. And again, well, I'll give it to you for six months. Well, I'll find a job, and six months will pass, and I'll have to leave, because the schedule will again be inappropriate. So if you give it away, then I'm afraid forever. And I don't even want to think about it. More and more often thoughts of suicide come, the only thing that still holds is a child. But it cannot go on that long. We will have nothing to eat this week. No help from anyone. I went to the mothers help center at the church. She asked for money to pay the debt for housing. They told me that they don't help with money. Then I asked the priest to talk to the parishioners, can someone help sit with the child, so that I can finally find a job. 2 weeks after the sermon, the priest made this request to the people, no one wanted to help. I do not already know where to go and what to do!",
1,I had a hysterics because of which I want to die.,
1,"I am 20 years old, my parents love me, but they divorced my mother found another husband, he and not everything is okay, I found a girl I think she fell in love with me, she wants to be just a friend to me, I have a brother, he is a student of my father, I saw that my dear father was left to live for a long time, I did not find her I’m not a handsome job, I’m a tramp, this is what I could write just in Russian I can’t write very much I’m not Russian. This is how I cry my life every day I just want to know the opinions of others",
1,"I'm tired of life. Although my life has never been easy, there was always hope for the best. From the age of 13 I was covered with acne, everything looked so terrible that one day some grandmother, seeing me on the street, crossed herself. The school teased me. But she reassured herself that everything would be fine. I entered the university that my dad chose. Specialty - ecologist. Dad was sure that he would give me a good job, his friend just worked in an environmental organization. I wanted to go to honey. college, but you can't argue with your father. But when I was in my 4th year, my dad died. What can I say, with my honors degree in ecology, I couldn't find a job for six months. Then I found it not in my specialty. I have 2 more brothers, the youngest was only 7 years old 2 weeks before his father's death. I live for them. My mother kicked me out of the house so that I would not interfere with her driving the men. I don't understand why I live, I have neither a husband nor children. While my peers were getting to know guys and getting married, I walked around covered in pimples and caused only disgust. Yes, now at 31, I do not have this problem, but there are no normal free men of my age, everyone is married. I am very tired of being alone. And I see no reason to continue living.",
1,"She left me. I am a finished creature. I continue to love her very much, she is a very good and kind person, but she could not love me. I don’t know what to do, today I lit a cigarette, this is me, the one who hasn’t drunk and smoked all my life and despised all this ... Lord, forgive me for everything, I was wrong, I am to blame for that, but it hurts so much, I don’t want to live, I have lost all sense of what to do, it’s so hard for me. I still remember how we spent time together and it strangles, kills me, my hands are shaking like an old man. What if she has someone else? he caresses her, hugs her, touches her naked body ... God my heart is breaking with pain! This has been going on for a month now, I pray that she will come back to me, send me sms, messages about the petition, I will really change, I will become someone you can love, but just come back to me! I love her more than life, Lord forgive me for everything, help me to cope with all this, I can not stand it.",
1,"I want to die, because I am tired of such a life. I hate myself and my reflection. I can't even lose weight, so that I like myself and others. I cannot realize myself in life, again being overweight interferes. I can't even find a boyfriend because no one pays attention to me. Yes, there is one guy that I really like, but who needs a piece of bacon?",
1,"I'm tired of life, my parents tell me to learn, but how can I learn, they also killed my studies. I used to do my homework every day and studied perfectly well, went to the computer rooms because of the computer they started beating me and I lost my life goals and lost my future profession. It is very difficult for me to study now, I was driven by thoughts about the future, that I will not have it all the same. I'm tired of this life and I decided to kill myself. Up to this point, I tried to kill myself so many times, but I could not. My family always speaks behind me and does not even say it in my face.",
1,Hey. My name is Maxim and I want to commit suicide.,
1,"I'm tired of everything. I'm tired of poverty. There is no work, as well as higher education, recently I went to design courses in order to get a profession. I try to learn, but deep down I don't believe that anything will come of it. It seems to me that I will receive my certificate and the maximum that it will serve me is to put it in a frame and admire it. And I will never get out of my swamp. I’m tired of my house, which looks little better than a barn, which is always damp and cold and there is nowhere to properly wash. Tired of walking for a year in the same shoes and not being able to afford everything that my peers can afford. I’m a pretty girl, but who’s going to look at someone with an ever-depressed expression on his face? Both acquaintances and strangers always tell me that I am sad, and I have already got used to it. There is no one to expect support from, my mother helps as much as she can, but I still feel nothing will come of this study. She said, if it doesn’t work out, then don’t expect any more help from her, and I think that it will be so. I had many plans and hobbies, but none of this I can do. Because everything comes down to money, whatever one may say. Do you want to write electronic music and play an instrument? Yes, it's my dream. But for this, buy a good instrument, not this log of yours, buy a normal computer that will allow you to write this very music without freezing every second. Buy headphones, an audio system, and so on and so forth. The list is endless. For whatever you take - everything depends on this damn money. In relationships, exactly the same unlucky. Recently, it turned out that my beloved person was simply using me as a temporary option. And I, no matter how logical my arguments are, no matter how I try to convince myself that all this needs to be endured, I am still in apathy with self-esteem tending to zero. All my relationships, including this one, have always been dependent. I made a man my world, and when this man left, he seemed to take my whole life with him. Naturally, I was depressed for months, consoling myself with alcohol and now and then trying to ""explain"" everything to myself and stop thinking about it. No matter how hard I try, I guess I just don't love myself. And neither the article nor self-persuasion helped me in this. I always do everything with an eye on the person who seems to me better than me. That's the same with the former. All my photos, all my activities, all my thoughts seemed to spite him, as if I were trying to prove to him who he had lost. Even though I know that he doesn't even remember me. I just don't know how to do something for myself and have lost all remnants of motivation. Probably just out of luck. All that remains is either to live a hated life and shove your dreams to hell, or to stop it all. I do not believe that the best is yet to come, as I have already noticed that every year of life becomes only worse than the previous one.",
1,Greetings to all ..,
1,", I want to immediately write that I am an egoist person ... in life with my beloved girlfriend I behaved unworthily, I worked late and raised my hand for some reason and I consider myself shit ... as a result, one day, on my initiative, we parted and it was mine a mistake, but in the end I realized that I am a schmuck that should not exist on earth ... I love her very much, and my actions are just disgusting ... and immediately after breaking up, she found herself a guy that tears me insanely into pieces, ready to beat him ... Every day I was torn to pieces several times already tried to commit suicide I do not eat hunger so sometimes ... And I understand that it is my own fault and this is the end and I can not let her go .. already on the verge of it is the end in the faces of passers-by I am constantly looking for her in pairs passing by me, I understand that I am going crazy day after day to forgive to let go of my own business or something else I have been trying ... At most I have enough for a day .. I understand that I am a piece of *** just this lonely apartment where it is quiet and peaceful I am going crazy ...

1," everyone. I don't even know where to start, maybe I just have no luck in life. maybe this is my fate, I can't bring my life back to normal, it still doesn't work out, I separated from my husband two years ago, and now I'm alone, although there are those who like me, but I don't have a relationship, my daughter goes to first grade. work ... it's hard with work, all around deception, count it for free a couple of times, but I try, at least to give my daughter everything I need, but a year ago an idea struck me. that in life I don't see any more meaning, everything is gray and everyday, I'm tired of dragging out my miserable existence, and I don't want to live anymore, all my life I have only torment (since childhood I have problems with teeth, treatment did not help at all, and recently I just had crowns, the amount for their treatment I just can't collect about 100,000 thousand for the entire jaw, but I don't want to be so disgusting, it hurts to be unnecessary for anyone, without someone who will calm down when it doesn't add up, as if I shouldn't was born. and no one made plans for my life (although this is a fact. I should not have been) and now, in a month I am 30, I just do not know where to find the strength to live further, and does it make sense in all this? in this world I am absolutely alone, nothing has been given to me, my mother has died. dad is indifferent to my life, not love, no care, not beauty, no talents, only one small ray to which I can not give anything ... just tired. wildly tired ...",
1,Good day to all. I often read stories on this forum. Sometimes I support people. There were difficult moments in my life and I wrote here. I am not a supporter of suicide. I try to always keep a positive mindset. But circumstances take their toll.,
1,"I don't want to live, I am a victim of my parents' overprotection. I have completely lack of social skills and the correct understanding of the world around me. In addition to all this, I am also an energy vampire, I like when other people suffer. In addition to all this, I have no feelings for many things, I generally keep quiet about love. My tows are similar to small children, I want to buy this for me, I also feel that everyone owes me everything and everything at once. Not life, but a fairy tale would have been said by many, but this fairy tale was in childhood, and now it looks more like hellish torments of overcoming oneself, and to be honest, it does not work. Something not good is seething inside me, constant comparison of myself with someone, excessive self-praise, daily searching for excuses and blaming others, I am also very trusting and naive and greedy. Yes, an interesting thing, I do not feel the time, for example, not understanding when to get a haircut or wash, since there is no such thing with brushing your teeth. My soul hurts, my body does not want anything, and my brain insists that nothing will work out for you and that it really doesn’t work. I understand that this is the end of my miserable existence, because only a miracle will help me, my parents say every day, go work, go learn, but I can’t do either.",

My one of the best friends, she already does not see herself at all as usual, she always rereads to me, sometimes even swears for a word that I can say (not even a mate).

In other lessons, when I go to the blackboard, angry comments from classmates are also poured on me. I have no talent, I am lazy, I can never bring myself to do anything. I have no friends, so I sit at home all day. I understand that whining and complaining about life is bad, but I just have no one to tell anything, to the question ""how are you"" I usually answer ""ok"", although it is very difficult to say. I am afraid that I will not pass the exams and will not take place in the future.",

1,"Since childhood, I grew up as a timid, modest, uncommunicative and impressionable child. In that teenage age, when some difficulties arose, I often convinced myself: I will grow up and everything will change. And so I grew up. Due to several traumatic events in my childhood, I lived according to the principle: never to be attached to anyone. In particular (at that time) it concerned my friends (I was always grateful to my parents for everything, and although they were divorced for about 10 years, and then got back together, I endured it without any difficulties). At the age of 20-25, I made a sufficient number of friends (friends at the place of residence, friends at school). I lived alone, my friends were also young and often liked to gather with me. With or without friends, but I was not bored alone at that time (from the age of 15 I lived separately from my parents as a student, and then I got a job and rented my own apartment). Loneliness was a joy to me. I was not bored, I could always find something to do without even leaving home. Relations with the opposite sex are not that they did not go well, I simply did not really look for them, since I did not know how to build a dialogue with the opposite sex, although the girls paid attention to me. And then the moment came when I connected my life with a girl. I will say right away - she was my dream. I have been waiting for our relationship for 3 years. Then we lived in a civil marriage for 1 year, and then another 4 years in marriage. During the time that we were married, we had a child who turned 3 years old. My wife didn’t have any friends, she was neutral. Since I was the first of all my friends to get married, the connection with me as a person who devoted himself to his family faded a little. And as a result, friends turned into acquaintances (and they themselves soon all got families and all left wherever). I experienced the loss of friends with a little regret, because I had the most precious thing - my family. Time passed, we lived with my wife. The passion of the first years passed, everyday problems often came to the fore, but even in the most difficult moment of misunderstanding between us, I thanked God for my spouse, child and family. But it all ends someday, so family happiness has come to an end. I learned about my wife's betrayal. How unfaithful she was to me, I did not delve into the question - my nerves were not iron, but the fact that she fell in love with another person did not require proof (although there was evidence of treason). I did not restrain my wife, I realized that I really love the other and they have mutual feelings. As a result - the third extra, I was left without a wife and without a child I adore. The wife left with the child, divorce. It turned out that living alone is now an impossible task for me. Having lived together for so many years and then like this - alone, I am completely beyond my powers. Sometimes a day is normal - I try to calm myself down, switch to something, another day - even like a wolf howl, melancholy finishes, a terrible depression, apathy piles on. And after all, you know, life doesn't end there, but ... and I wouldn't be here if I hadn't typed in the browser search: ""I'm tired of life ..."" Actually, that's how I ended up on this site.",

My husband often humiliated me, I feel insignificant, I used to raise my hand while intoxicated, I broke my nose three times, I am silent about anything else, for more than a year, silence, measured life, recently learned about pregnancy, love the first crazy, decided to give birth. Today I decided to speak out that I didn’t like it, it’s just boiling, they promise to sign for as long as we live, but time is passing and the second is on the way. As a result, he got mad, said that he would never marry such a girl, and what I generally hope for, in the end he beat me up, because she roared, and there was a son nearby who said that you shouldn't offend girls (meaning me). He hit on the ears, face and hands, told me to pack up my things and get rid of that I wasn’t needed by anyone. I went to bed as if nothing had happened, and most importantly, he was sober and that made it even worse. I don't want to live, I'm just a nonentity. He killed everything feminine and living in me, I am like a vegetable, I don’t want to live if it were not for my son, I would already be 100% in another world, but I still doubt, I’m afraid that in the end I’ll do it.",

I am a complete social phobia, I constantly sit at home, I am afraid of people, and also these screams and screams from the family ... I am so tired. I don't know where to run, I don't know what to do. I want to die almost every day. I cry a lot. I have not had friends since I was 13, my friends were traitors and I decided to leave them and break off all communication with them. And more - I have not found a single girlfriend, not a single person with whom you can at least take a walk ... The guys don't look at me, I'm probably too wretched in appearance. I slouch, dress as lightly as possible, and my hair is terrible and unkempt. I don’t want to live completely, every day I think about how I would have been killed by a maniac or run over by a car ... In my school years I was an outcast, I was smacked, and even now, if I see someone from my school, they start to insult and push me. I am very hurt and hurt. I live in a big city, but there is no sense. Everyone walks in pairs or with friends, and I'm a lonely and downtrodden mouse ...",

As I naively believed then it was a person who will be with me for life. I heard it from him, I knew it myself. Seven months after the beginning of the relationship, I found out that I was pregnant. Say, it's her own fault, you started to live an intimate life too early, you had to wait and generally don't know what a condom is? I understand everything, I have played all these taunts several thousand times in my head .. but at that moment, I repeat, I naively believed that this was mine .. that this relationship was for life .. the man wanted this child, talked about how we will be happy that everything will be fine with us .. but the relationship began to collapse .. my harmonies, his pens, tears, tantrums, parting and reconciliation .. all this lasted 5 months .. for a period of five months he quit me .. I took my things and left .. I don’t know where to go .. I feel like a burden for my family .. I feel hatred for this person, for myself and, worst of all, for my still unborn daughter .. it seems that life has lost all meaning, that I have no place and I ruin everything around with my existence ...

School and life are even worse for her - constant publishing, beatings, even friends and they scoffed, there were few moments of norms. I was a computer maniac as a child and this was the main mistake and maybe this is the reason for all of mine to miss. Instead of taking a walk, I sat day and night in the computer, which ruined my eyesight, but worst of all ruined my childhood. Now I am 16 years old, but life has not changed much, I am still a lonely outcast, because nothing else in my life shone on me, and this may have taken away from depression. At the age of 15, my mother died in 2016, I killed her with the words I want to die, and her lover stabbed me physically ... As a child, I was afraid to die and did not want to, but at the age of 13 I had a desire to commit suicide, but I lack the courage. There is only one joyful prospect - my grandmother is alive, which is dearer to me than my mother and loved me more than my mother. I want to die, but it's hard to do.

1,". I am 14 years old and I feel that my mother does not love me. When I was six months old, my mother left my father. We lived with my grandmother, my mother worked day and night. When her salary was raised, she bought all the money for travel, at that time I was 4 years old, every vacation she spent without me. In fact, I grew up without parents, my grandmother, because of this, I often quarreled with my mother, but I could not do anything. A year later, my mother met my stepfather, after a couple of months they got married. The stepfather did not show any interest in me, he simply did not notice me, and even now, too. When I was 7 years old my sister was born, and they completely forgot about me. I treat my sister very well, I understand that she is not to blame for anything. I was 10 when my relationship with my mother just came to naught. Every day she reproached me for something, sometimes it came to fights. Now, the relationship has become a little better, but still, I do not feel any care and warmth towards me. With my younger sister, she travels everywhere, every day she says that she loves her very much, I still do not notice me. She tells me that she feeds me and dresses me, but she is not obliged to do another. Recently, my friends betrayed me, and I was left alone. About this, she said that I was a fool, and should go and make peace with them, because (according to her) no one wants to communicate with such a stupid one as me. For all my achievements, she does not praise me, I am an excellent student, I take first places in regional Olympiads, I play the piano, but she says that every fool can do this, and when my sister does something, she says that she is great, not like me. Sometimes during quarrels, she screams out that she does not love me. If I had the opportunity, I would leave home, but I have nowhere to go. I don't know what to do, what is wrong with me. Sometimes you don't even want to live. Tell me what to do",
1,"I am 27 years old, I am 8 months pregnant. I got into a terrible life situation from which I see no way out. Throughout my pregnancy, I have been under terrible stress, and now it has come to the point that I want to commit suicide. She is to blame for everything, for everything. She drove herself into a dead end. The problem is that I dated a man for 3 years, performed 2 abortions from him, undermined my women's health, I was sure that we were about to part. After the second abortion, I made the final decision to part with him, but he crawled on his knees and begged me not to leave him, and well, I broke down and continued my relationship with him, although I knew it was a big mistake. I was not going to connect life with him, but for some reason I continued to meet and spend my precious years on him. I don't know if this is love or just a complete lack of brains, since this man did a lot of bad things, I will not describe everything, I will write the most important thing. I got pregnant from him for the third time, I want to note that we used protection. It was simply deadly for me, since the third abortion would have been too much, I hid it from everyone for a long time, went - I thought what to do. As a result, at the 3rd month of pregnancy, she told him and her parents. Bottom line: they had a wedding, I moved in with him and the most ""fun"" began - a complete lack of money and a huge debt hole. I am unemployed, he works for a penny seven days a week, and pays all the salary for loans. It happens that there is no money even for travel. My pregnancy is going through with complications, they prescribed a bunch of medications that are simply necessary for bearing a child, I had to buy medications from my credit card, which, unfortunately, I did not block in due time. Parents themselves are all in debt because of our wedding, I try not to tell them everything, as they are very worried and without that they help a lot with food and money. In a month of childbirth, I just can't imagine how we will live. Everything seems to me in a gray color, I do not see any way out of this situation at all, my husband has huge debts and he does nothing to somehow solve the problem. The child will live in poverty, wear everything shabby, I have no opportunity to go to the store and buy something for the baby, but I really want to ... And I will never have such an opportunity.

It was even hard for me to communicate on Skype, because because of the face, in general, we talked to him 37 said that he would come in October, then he disappeared, I began to write myself, I began to take the initiative, then I wrote that I didn't like it and tell me, you had a fight, I wrote to him that he is a mama's son, at 37 he lives with his mother, he said that he had lost interest in me and said ""God help you in finding a husband."" I think because of my face and that I have small breasts. Mom said that I don't need to get married, that a man needs a healthy woman, but as a normal person I can't get up and immediately go to the kitchen and cook or just drink tea, I need to get up EARLY to treat my face, put on my lenses, today the bleeding has opened, everything poured on the floor, while I cleaned the bed, the morning went by with psychos. Why is God so with me, I am afraid of God, I am afraid that it will be even worse for me, I will probably never have children, for which I confessed I am very sorry about my sins I often cry because of them and received communion, but everything is worse and worse and worse, plus I live with my father as an alcoholic, in the team they also dislike it because one, they all have guys, and I'm alone, I don't know what to do, I want to leave this life, I live in some kind of darkness.",

1,". I would like to tell my story. I am 20 years old and every day I think about suicide, because I have absolutely nothing in my life. The fact is that from early childhood my parents took too much care of me, overly praised and took care of me. At the moment I am studying at a university and only now I understand that I myself cannot understand any life situation, everywhere I am looking for a question or advice from the outside, that's right in every simple matter. I believe that there is no point in living like this without my opinion and there is no point in living like this, because a man at my age should be able to stand up for himself, understand at least something, and I just take offense at most everything that is said in my direction. Whatever I undertake, even if it will later turn out well for me, I still give up this business after a while, perhaps it is the fault of the part of the computer that I have been sitting at since I was 10, but only now I decided to give it up ... Also, lately, all my former acquaintances and friends are gradually moving away from me, and I think this is due to the fact that I have no interest in anything in life, I don't even know what to do next. When I try to tell them something, no one really listens to me, and when others speak, I delve into it and take it too close to my heart. Summing up, I want to say only one thing, do not play at the computer as much as I played it (from 10 to 20 years old)",
1,"I just do not want. I do not want to be another man in the street, living by a template. I see no reason to do something, work, study, there is no desire to achieve anything. I feel guilty (?)

I waited for him for a year from the army ""as a friend"", but I constantly told him that I have feelings and I would not betray him with my body either, because I love and cannot betray my feelings. He said that he believed, after the army he came and confessed love, said that we will be together. After the first sex, he changed, stopped showing signs of attention and later wrote ""you are the same as everyone else, I never believed you, because you are beautiful!"" It turned out that he was twice in love with beautiful girls, the second of them was generally a porn photo model and they betrayed him. But why is he taking revenge on me? What is my fault? I can’t cry anymore .. I don’t understand what’s going on .. I want to die because I was sincere with him, I put my soul into this relationship, I believed that he was the one who would appreciate my loyalty and love, everything was so good .. And he insulted me just because I was born with a beautiful face? I was never proud of this, I do not consider myself directly beautiful, just an ordinary face, not crooked but ordinary, on the contrary, I always aspired to study, received 2 educations so that my boyfriend would be proud of me ..

1,". I'm 16 years old. I'm in 11th grade. My problem is that I don’t want anything. At all. I have no hobbies, I don’t like anything. Therefore, I don’t know who to study. Before, choosing a profession, I was looking for the best option in terms of salary (the higher salary, the more this specialty attracted me). At first I wanted to be a doctor, but then I realized that I didn’t like working with people, and for some reason I hated this profession, then I wanted to become a lawyer, but still doubted. And despite this, I decided to take the Unified State Exam in history and social studies. But I changed my mind again, because this job scares me (I was told that after a lost case, one lawyer was stabbed to death with his family. Yes, yes, I am also a coward). At the end of the 10th grade, for some reason I chose more specialized mathematics (in general, I hoped to become a programmer, but nothing shines for me there). Having suffered a severe depression during the summer holidays (I am still in it, to be honest), I realized that nothing attracted me, I began to be afraid of people. Even though I want to love my job and work not with grief in half, I DON'T KNOW WHOM TO GO TO LEARN ON. Even if I go somewhere, I am afraid that later I will not work in my specialty. All my classmates have already decided, they walk happy. And I have no purpose in life. I do not know what to do after school. This thought depresses me. I have no talents, nature even cheated me with my appearance. I am very nervous and depressed, and also with low self-esteem. And besides, all my life without friends. I don’t want to sit on my parents’s neck. However, I don’t want to get married. I don’t know how to live, what to become. I don’t know what I want. Suicide attempts were, yes. But in the time of depression. Recently I have not been happy. My mother tells me that this is all because I am lazy (and you can’t argue) Although I study well, and the assignments that I am given on time. I just want to lie down. and not wake up. Thank you for your attention.",
1,"История банальна. Замуж вышла 6 лет назад. 4 года не получалось забеременеть.  Удалось стать мамой только благодаря эко. Конфликты в семье появились сразу после брака. Уже тогда задумалась о разводе,  но все надеялась на лучшее. Муж работящий, без вп, но ужасный зануда. Из за неправильной, по его мнению,  загрузки стиральной машины может устроить скандал.  Потом умер мой отец. Через год – мама. Брата не стало еще раньше в 2007 году. Состояние ужасное. Осталась абсолютно одна.  Спустя 2 года сделали эко и родился сын. В период беременности муж постоянно унижал, я плакала. Но уйти не могла, своего жилья не было, квартира в ипотеке, родни нет. Малыш родился капризным, в первые 1.5 м я почти выпала из жизни. Поддержки никакой, муж работал с первого же дня, как привез нас из роддома. На работе ему отказали взять  выходные. После кесарево было очень тяжело, ребенок ужасно нервный, крики круглые сутки. Ничего не могу сказать  - после работы муж всегда помогал в чем нужно, если позволяла возможность  - приезжал с работы в течение дня,  чтобы я могла элементарно покушать и сходить в душ. Когда сыну исполнилось полгода, мы решили поменять пмж. Планы были давно, но тут ситуация обострилась тем, что после декрета мне бы пришлось выйти на другую работу, ипотека – долг. Мы продали квартиру и уехали в другой регион, поближе к его родителям.  На оставшиеся от закрытия  ипотеки деньги купили хорошую квартиру, пусть не в новом доме, но все же. Муж нашел работу быстро. Хочу заметить, что смена работы для него в порядке вещей – он очень конфликтный..По его мнению, виновата я. Это мне мало зарплаты, хотя он действительно получает всегда мало, при наличии кредита у нас просто не оставалось денег ни на что, едва дотягивали до зарплаты.  На новом месте жительства проблемы остались прежними  - каждодневная ссора. Крики с его стороны. По его мнению, я не уважаю его и не считаюсь с его мнением, я корыстная и мне всегда мало денег.  Я круглые сутки с ребенком. Выйти и сходить куда то кроме магазина не могу. Муж возмущается, что сын с ним беспокойный и он не справляется. Пока он на работе, я круглые сутки с ребенком. Малыш беспокойный,  все время на взводе, не скажу, что устала физически, но морально просто убита. Материнство не радует. Денег нет даже сходить в салон красоты или купить новые вещи или книгу. За каждую покупку муж отчитывает, что я живу не по средствам, хотя я получаю неплохие декретные. Каждый день слышу упреки в свой адрес, оскорбления и унижения..Не уважаю его как мужчину, презираю. Но куда уйти – не знаю. Грозит в случае развода отнять ребенка  (в юр. вопросах он хорошо подкован), тем, что убьет меня, но жить буду с ним. Интима нет очень давно..Как мужчина он мне противен. Удовольствия не получаю, да и морально не могу его подпустить. Сын растет в нездоровой обстановке. Это еще сильнее гнетет меня. Говорить не получается . Он сразу переходит на крик. Нас уже знают все новые соседи из за постоянных оров.  К психологу идти не хочет, говорит, что тут и без психолога ясно – я его не уважаю, я вижу корнем всех проблем его и так далее..Я не могу уважать истеричку, увы. Куда уйти с сыном? У меня никого нет.В новом городе даже нет работы теперь. Кризисных центров тоже нет. У подруг своя жизнь, свои заботы, да и я не люблю выносить сор из избы. Виню себя за то, что живу с таким человеком  Что сын вынужден расти в такой обстановке. Знаю, что виновата сама, и от этого еще больнее. Иногда просто хочу покончить с собой, но думаю о сыне и не могу решиться, хотя уже все спланировала. Как быть и куда пойти  - не знаю.",

I will complain to her about all my problems, tell her why she gave birth to me, that I do not want to live. I am ashamed to say that, but I even feel a certain pleasure when she starts to get nervous. After I finish it, it becomes much easier for me. It's like I'm some kind of energy vampire. Moreover, I allow myself this only with her, I can still do this with my grandmother, but I still try not to do this to her, because she has a bad heart. I don’t do this with my dad, my other grandmother, my sister, or anyone else.

And recently I could not stand it and told her these words that she considers me unnecessary. And my mother got angry, started hitting me, right on the street, thank God it was evening. When we got home, she started hitting me again. But she also said a lot of hard and offensive things, that I was nobody to her, that she didn’t need me, that she would kick me out of the house, that she no longer considered me a daughter, and much more, it’s impossible to retell everything. But the most offensive thing was when she said that I was no longer her daughter and that she would applaud the person who would hurt me.",

But yesterday I walked and thought that there was no way out, I had no other way but to free everyone from my presence. My parents have been dead for a long time, my brother left me homeless, I live with a guy with his mother for six months. I can’t take off on my own, only a couple of packs of diapers can be bought on maternity leave. And my character over the long years of my life in removable corners with strangers is explosive, I get started with half a turn and start yelling, it’s already sickening, but it’s impossible to stop and control myself. I don’t call him with a boyfriend, my husband, as his mother said - why do you need to marry, and he’s not going to, despite the child. Six years together, they didn't quarrel, so little things. But with his mother every week, and he slowly fell out of love with me, of course, who would like that they are fighting with his mother. I knew that she was a very complicated person, he had not introduced me to her for five years, only gifts were exchanged in absentia. He warned that if we moved to her, it would be difficult. And me - oh well, everything will be fine, but you won't have to pay for housing. Lack of sleep, fatigue, the child is very small - and the fact that I hung the rag in the wrong place, that I put the cup in the wrong place, the eternal dirt that I have to clean up alone, the graters in the kitchen because of the next garbage, her constant desire to humiliate me: and her leg is more graceful, and her height is taller, and she cooks better ... And I explode, start yelling to get behind, she yells that I’m on their neck in her apartment and to roll away. The guy freaks out and yells. Beauty. Yesterday I could not stand it, after another psychosis with his mother, I left a couple of rags in a suitcase and left, accompanied by a cry ""leave the keys."" I walked for half an hour on the street, thinking how my daughter would be without me, came back, asked for forgiveness. And the thought that it will never end will never end well. The guy already hates, his mother, too - I didn't choose you, that's how you need it, that you are not at home, you had to think with your brains when you trusted your brother ... she is having fun, why can't she keep silent.

They had to collect all their savings to pay off the interest on the loan. I took out a loan for myself for 5 years at lower interest rates to close loans with higher interest rates, they already had debts. A month ago we learned that my sister continues to take debts from other banks and send them to the army.

Then I studied in the USA, and you know what, my uncle did not want me to live with them, and sent me back, I thought that I would live there, but I was wrapped in this hole, at the bottom.

1,". I, like most people here probably, am writing out of despair ... I'll start over. I was born at 32 weeks. And apparently this unhappy childhood gave me such a nervous system. Since childhood, I have had ... panic attacks ... neurosis ... depression. I am already silent about physical illnesses ... I was beaten as a child. Did not understand. And it seems to me, they did not love. My father left us when I was born. And my mother took it out on me. I was basically a calm child, I read almost all the time ... I studied well. Then in high school there was an aggravation of panic attacks and agoraphobia ... I could not even go to school. Then he let go. At the age of 18, she left her parents. To the future husband. She gave birth to a son. 9 years ago. I immediately began a terrible aggravation of everything. Which continues to this day. Only it got worse and worse. Now I can no longer live without pills - concor for tachycardia ... phenazepam for fear. Cetrin for urticaria - every day. If I don't drink all the skin is torn. The reason was not found. We parted with my husband several times. Since I'm hysterical. And I don't know how to live in a family without quarrels. This is evident from childhood ... But I try ... study. Thanks to my husband for being with me. I am a very difficult person. I scream .... often aggression. Sometimes I act like a child. Psychotherapists, psychologists and other doctors cannot help me. Half a year ago I got pregnant with my second child .... but unfortunately panic attacks and neurosis hit me with such force. That I could not stand it and drank pills. The doctors said to have an abortion. Half a year later is at the moment. I decided to try again. Either now or never I thought. Years go by. And she got pregnant again ... I thought it would be better. But no. Now 4 weeks of ber. Panic attacks and neurosis and all the symptoms that can be aggravated. Pulse jumps to 170. Pressure too. The fear is terrible. I am afraid of tachycardia. To the horror. I continue to drink concor even with anaprilin attack. This is a risk for the child. The husband generally says all this at the wrong time. No money, etc. ... no apartment ... no car. I don't work .... Yes, I agree. But what to do now. I can not. I no longer have the strength ... thoughts are bad. Everything hurts. The panics are terrible. The ambulance doesn't take me seriously. Doctors can do nothing. Now I think on such stresses and pills ... why did I get pregnant ... I'm crying. I so want a second child. But this is my body. ... apparently it was not necessary to start all this. Lord .... I'm so scared. And this is just the beginning. I am an unfulfilled unhappy person. I think I made a mistake. That I can't handle the pregnancy. I can't cope with myself. These are constantly panics. I can't work. I don’t follow through. Yes, and I'm not very mistress. I cry every day that I cannot bring joy to loved ones, but only disappointment. I don't want anything. ...I can not. Not life but torment of loved ones. Sometimes even thoughts about the bad.

1,"Briefly about yourself. I am from a simple, not wealthy family, I grew up and lived in a small town with a population of no more than 15,000. My parents were well brought up and educated. I studied at school almost perfectly. Then he entered the technical school in the targeted direction and graduated from it. Then he served in the army, where he was a gun commander with the rank of sergeant. A month after military service, I got a job, where I wore a shirt and did not lift a hand heavier, and immediately entered the academy for a correspondence course. Then a year later he took an apartment in Astrakhan on a mortgage without interest and bought a good foreign car. At the same time he was engaged in trade. Things were going very well, my friends and relatives were proud of me that I achieve everything myself. All this time I loved one girl. She was married and has a child. We met in secret. 2 years ago I told my parents that I love her and want to be with her. They were against it, but I insisted on it. And then he transferred to Astrakhan for his own work. We lived with her in her apartment, and they rented mine. We went to rest abroad and to our seas, in a word we lived happily. But things did not go well, I took another loan. A year ago, my parents played us a wedding, began to communicate very well with her parents, I am very attached to the child, and he to me. It seems that everyone loved each other. At our wedding, 100 people were poisoned, the glory of God cost a maximum of weeks in the hospital. The fifth and sixth years at the academy were transferred to Moscow, and there the prices were ""space"". Financial difficulties set in. My wife paid for her mortgage herself and for the car loan for her car, which she took before the wedding. As a result, this year I took an academic leave in my last year, put my parents on loans, I myself was mired in them, in debt and even in microfinance. My wife and I have not lived together for several months, there are problems at work, they want to take the apartment for delays on the mortgage, I am driving now in an old Zhiguli, which is even older than me, in a word I fucked up everything and my family and everything that was.",
1,"I have two suicide attempts. I am a transsexual. Observed by psychotherapists. I was engaged in art, which delayed me in this life for some time. I met a beautiful girl with a bunch of family problems, problems with society. He supported her in everything. I love without memory, planned a joint future, visited them in Moscow. She was happy. But her psychological problems do not allow her to live in peace, and I can do nothing to help. She often thinks about suicide, saw the meaning of life only in me. But we are separated by thousands of kilometers and she is terribly bored. I'm not around, and it is killing her. She is the meaning of life for me, what she holds. The most precious thing. And I see how my dearest is slowly dying and leaving me, so that I do not prevent her from ending everything.",
1,"My story is a self-deception in which I play. You know how many broken souls there are in this life, and one of them is now writing and asking for advice from you very much. Who thought that life is a scene in which we live and play. To begin with, I was 19, I met the guy of my dreams by the standards that I wrote in my head and on the first day of our acquaintance I slept as I knew that I would tie it to me. And so it happened I'm 26 he is next to me I lie constantly emu uchobu abandoned for him and he does not know the parents do not know so all zabrehla.

Now I regret that I did this from my life, I lived it out now and I can get out of it, maybe I can help the emu in the dictatorship with money now I’m not as good as I was, I’ve warmed the snake on my shoulders and I endure it, but I love the ego madly, but I still see a little bit and I’ll become a vegetable that I ghehochu not live for for someone just to swallow pills I'm all for him and he strangles me until I lose consciousness in the direct sense. because of the enemies. I understand them, I would do that too, but I chose either my darling or friends. he flies in life and I sit and just reframe as he said, stupid, but you know, he loves me, we have good sex, but we don’t have a sincere one I can’t sit down and speak, I can only listen to him and regret and understand. but he doesn’t understand me and probably will not be able to live. Assoc. How can I explain it to her, she will simply hate me, I will be kind to everyone, I help everyone, I do everything so that they can live well, and I eat myself from the inside and go crazy, I recently wanted to commit suicide <ed. mod.> and then I could not think about this what I want or play deceiving myself. what to do I don’t know how to live everything is so confused what do you think should I exist in this world what should I do to leave or stay how to act correctly? thanks for reading.",
1,". I am soon 22 years old and the feeling that I have wasted 22 years out of 22 of my life does not leave me. I am still alone and I have no friends or girlfriend. As a child, I was a very sickly child, I was only enrolled in a kindergarten, I came there literally for 2-3 days, and then again I had bronchial asthma, and for a very long time no one could do anything about it, but it seems that this ailment is from I retreated but it didn't get any easier. Naturally, I had no friends then, because I just sat at home and could not go anywhere. Then I went to school and realized that I could not establish contact with my peers, but over time everything seemed to be getting better, I began to have ""friends"" who, as it turned out, just wanted to cheat my homework or play with me on the phone simply because that they were bored. Nobody called me and still does not call me. Nobody invites anywhere and is unlikely to invite. I will continue further all finished 9 classes, these ""friends"" ran away from me, but I had one friend as it seemed to me a real one, we communicated well with him, but this was only limited by the school. And so we finished school, and everyone again scattered in all directions, I lost touch with him and the other day I tried to restore it, but it seems to me that he no longer cares about me, and he is full of his own problems. Here in the 11th grade I had love, but not mutual, I got angry with myself and this girl, I said such nasty things to her, which I really regret and I am ashamed of myself. I entered the university, I got a friend there, but he was from another city and now he went there. We again communicated with him only within the framework of the university, he even tried to invite me somewhere, but for some reason they couldn't get me out of the house. The girls began to show interest in me, but everything ended in nothing, because I either did not like her, or I did not know how to approach her, and if they did, they quickly sewed me off. I graduated from university, entered the magistracy, went to work. At work, a boring team of women, I'm a guy, there is nothing to talk about: everyone has children, cats, dogs, all talk about this. While I was at the last session in the magistracy, I was pulled by the ears by a girl with whom I had studied before and who, by the way, showed interest in me, to take a walk to celebrate my admission with her group. I felt like a third person there, everyone was having fun, but I didn't know where to stick myself, I don't even know what to talk about with this girl. As a result, this girl has a fiancé, she will soon be married, all my classmates are with girls, and classmates will soon be married. And I am still alone, everyone has betrayed me, nobody needs me, I am stuck in my four walls, I cannot talk to people, although I really want to, because something is bothering me. I became angry and I vent my anger at my family, it seems to me that my life is meaningless. Help, I don't want to live like this.",

1,"I am 55 years old. I am an alcoholic. I tried to quit, it doesn’t work. Children (son and daughter) adults. I understand, they don’t like what I drink. Conflicts with my husband. I don’t know what to do. I see only one way out, to leave this life. may everyone be better this way.",
1,"I am 27 years old. For the last 2 years I have been thinking about suicide. I live in a beautiful southern city, until I was 9 years old I was a cheerful child. But then everything changed. At first, I was transferred from the gymnasium to a regular school, relations with classmates did not work out. Mom could not look after me, she took me to a distant relative. Her elderly husband turned out to be a pedophile. I was little then and did not understand that something terrible and wrong was happening. For this she did not say anything to anyone. Later, the brain blocked this memory, I remembered only at his funeral, when I was 22 years old. I was ashamed, scared to tell my relatives. And I was silent.",
1,", my name is Eugene, I am 15 years old and I don’t want to live anymore, because I’m tired of being constantly offended by everyone (classmates). I am easily driven to suicide. I take offense at the words ""No"" and ""You can't"", especially ""You can't"" as I hear, I want to hang myself right away. Why live if everything is impossible so let me die and this will not happen in the next world. I don’t understand for what purpose one must live, why live and I don’t have to live anyway, no one loves me and everyone hates me. Why live if you die anyway? What is the meaning of life and is it worth living for me on. A few days ago I was at school, as the lessons ended, I quickly went home to hang myself, and my parents were at home, so I put it aside. Everyone noticed the cuts on my hands from suicide - should I go on living or dying? I'm tired of everything.",
1,"5 years ago my relationship with Seryozha began. For 5 years I have experienced everything. From parting to break away on the weekend, returning to the ex, constant name-calling and like 4 years of assault. First, counting, grabbing, hair-pulling. Everything is stable every two weeks. Particularly strong plowing of anger for all holidays. I don't smoke, I don't drink. I do not communicate in any way with the male sex, not at work, or anywhere. I am not a hysteric, I do not rush myself. I used to have both fans and friends.",
1,"Help!!!! Help please !!!!! I can't stand it, I'm ready to lay hands on myself, it hurts so much!",
1," everyone! I have such a story, I have real loneliness and I am so tired of this life. I am writing because I want to speak out. I am 34 years old, I have a daughter, a job, etc. It so happened that my daughter lives with my mother, I live in another city (450 km. From them). I have a man who seems to be not bad. But I am lonely, I do not feel life in me, I live on autopilot, I work because I need money to live (I rent an apartment), I have acquaintances, but no friends (I don’t need it). My man, just yesterday, made it clear that he would not have a family with him, I was like a transshipment option for him (we have been living for 2 years together). He didn’t say so directly, but the conversation was about “I’m already old (40 years old), I don’t need young ones, only old women shine for me, and old women already have children, but I realized that I was not ready to live with a woman and her a child as a family (he has children from different marriages, he was married three times), but he also wants his own child. ""From this conversation, I realized that I had to"" turn over ""for him. What the heck? Sorry . Why ... I never came across a normal man, I met this one, I thought ""Well, finally ..."", but no, it was not there))). I don’t suffer, no, it doesn’t hurt me, I’m just now sure that I’m not needed here, a failure of the system, an error ... I have a void inside, there’s nothing, no emotions. You will say that your daughter ... I will not say that I do not love her, I love her, I love her very much, but I am no mother, I can not give anything to the child, I’m scanty, barely enough to survive, I don’t have my own home. and it will never be (I really look at life), I definitely can't make money, I can't get an ipoptek either, I don't work officially, the residence permit is temporary (by coincidence, I can't register anywhere, long history, it takes a long time to explain why ), well, I have nowhere to register, of the relatives only my mother and stepfather, with whom we have no relationship, in general, we hate each other, my mother is forbidden to let me on the doorstep. I'm not scary, pretty pretty, slender, tall, not stupid, but ""not alive"". There was a sea of ​​betrayal, starting with my mother ... I don't take offense at her, it's just that she is ... So, I don't know what to do with myself, I don't know ... how to find interest in life? How to find yourself? The feeling that I died, only the body exists, and the soul died, I repeat once again, there are no emotions, there is no joy or sadness, I do not feel anything (it was not always like this), I used to be a very emotional person, I suffered a lot, cried, I admired a lot, rejoiced a lot, and now NOTHING. What happened with me ?",
1,", I need help very urgently. I do not think at all about the consequences of my actions. And my actions are VERY bad. Somewhere in the fifth grade, I began to have a tendency towards cruelty. Then I suggested to my friend that we become gopniks. She agreed. They want to kick me out of school, because I almost strangled a third grader, tried to rob him and stole some candy from a classmate. Ideas often appear to commit suicide. But the worst thing is that before I just cried and thought to commit suicide and not suffer, but this time I noticed that I am more confident that this is a good way out. I'm trying to convince myself that everything is still not so bad, but I think soon the madness will take up. I just do something and do not think why, and why I am doing it. Am I out of my mind? And what should I do about my tendency to be violent? Please help me soon! I'm really scared.",

There was a fight, the guy got a few bruises and scratches from the pebbles. They applied for me, but the cops convinced us not to apply. As already clear, for the sake of their own interest. They took me to the police car under shouts that I was a brute and would still have time to go to jail, and that they would definitely put me in prison.",

1,"здравсвуйте всем.. Мне 26 лет, девушка.. пишу сюда в надежде хоть здесь найти душевный отклик... уже второй или третий месяц нахожусь в критическом состоянии.. от меня ушел любимый человек, с которым я провела 8 лет своей жизни... ушел во второй раз.. первый раз на втором году отношений изменил мне, на стороне родился ребёнок, о чем я узнала лишь спустя год.. по этой причине был его первый уход-муки совести и невозможность при таких обстоятельствах быть вместе.. но получается, она ходила беременная 9 месяцев, а я была ни сном ни духом, делила с ним постель, простила измену.. не суть.. 2 года он гулял, искал себя, как я понимаю пытался строить дичную жизнь и даже жил с НЕЙ месяц.. только вот почему то она ушла от него, сбежала.. каким то образом спустя эти 2 года мы сошлись вновь.. я даже не поняла как это произошло.. цветы.. подарки.. и вот мы живем вместе.. первый раз за 6, на тот момент лет.. год живем.. делаем ремонт.. пытаемся ужиться в быту.. ездим отдыхать.. обычные отношения..он делает мне предложение на 7 ой год отношений со словами ""я очень долго думал и решил"". я соглашаюсь.  каждый день думаю о его дочери.. и плачу.. забыла сказать, что на 2 ом году отношений я следала от него аборт, ибо ""КАКОЙ ИЗ МЕНЯ ОТЕЦ""(что не помешало ему стать отцом через год после этого..). Все то время, пока мы живем вместе, он твердит мне, что я не такая, здесь не то, ни к чему не стремлюсь, работа у меня тупая, я деградирую, что у всех вот так, а у нас нет. хотя материально я никогда от него не зависела, ничего не просила.. не соответствую я его ожиданиям, его идеальной картинке. убираюсь плохо, готовлю редко.. Не мотивирую и не поддерживаю, хотя я старалась как могла..У него своя фирма, если это имеет значение.. к свадьбе мы не идем, дальше предложения не зашло. Он открыл нам магазинчик, который в итоге не стал приносить прибыль и через полгода я предложила его продать, пока не поздно, чтоб вернуть ему хоть какие то деньги.. занималась этим магазином я и поняла, что я больше не хочу этим заниматься и заставлять себя. Мне все время казалось, что он мой начальник, постоянные указания, тычки носом.. Крики за опоздания, хотя даже по документам все оформила на себя.. Как только он понял, что я не шучу, имею свое мнение и не желаю идти на компромисс, он берет ПАУЗУ  и уезжает жить отдельно, что конечно же было не раз за 8 лет и я не придала этому значения.. думала успокоится, пройдем очередной кризис и все.. Нет.. за то время, пока он жил отдельно, магазин продался. Я осталась без средств к существованию, но это исключительно мои проблемы, так как общего бюджета у нас на было НИКОГДА, а жили то на мои то на его. Только никогда я подумать не могла, что человек может оставить меня во второй раз. не в средствах дело.. как только я поняла, что он не вернется..у меня сдали нервы.. я не узнавала себя..у меня начались панические атаки, я болялась выйти из дома.. Я смотрела в зеркало и не узнавала свое отражение. Все как во сне. Ни одной эмоции в душе. Я не могла сходитьв душ, сделать элементарные вещи, потому что мой мозг просто не хотел меня слушать..Я не знаю как все это обьяснить. Аппогеем всего стал день, когда я молча сидела на кухне, а он собирал вещи. Собрал и ушел. На следующий день я пришла домой и не осталось ничего от него, пока я была на работе он забрал телевизор и остатки своей одежды.. я не ела неделю, я не могла.С тех пор мой мозг будто заблокировал все процессы.. Меня третий месяц мучает непостижимое мне чувство вины.. Перед всеми.. Мна кажется что я виновата перед всеми.. это ощущается на физическом уровне.. Я не вижу своего будущего..Я не знаю зачем мне работать, зачем мне деньги.. Зачем мне кушать и что либо делать.. Покажется наверно все это ерундой.. Но будто во мне черная дыра .. у меня постоянное чувство деперсонализации и дереализации.. Я сравниваю себя со всеми, сситаю себя никчкмной, ничего не добившейся, и не вижу смысла ничего добиваться.. мне кажется я ничего не могу дать окружающим, даже в плане просто общения.. хотя всегда слыла интересным человеком.. Я ненавижу себя.. ненавижу.. за что я могу себя любить если человек ушел от меня ДВАЖДЫ? даже не смотря на мое прощение, смирение.. каждый вечер я надеюсь не проснуться. я не могу простить. я виню во всем себя. я ненавижу себя. в тайне надеясь что он вернется. с другими мужчинами избегаю общения, потому что чувствую что пуста.. мне нечего отдать эмоционально.. боюсь показаться неинтересной.. мне кажется он меня просто сломал...я не знаю как жить и зачем.. я доверилась во второй раз и снова зря.. я хочу пойти к психиатру, но чувствую что кроме себя самой не поможет никто.. но сама я не справляюсь.. невыносимо жить.. не видя смысла.. весь смысл был в нем.. я ходила в церковь, просила Господа помочь простить.. и дать сил жить.. но их нет.. и каждый вечер в течение 3 месяцев я буквально ложусь и сворачиваюсь, чтобы не повеситься.. то ли надеясь, что не проснусь, то ли на на то, что утром полегчает..этот человек об этом знает, о моем состоянии..ему плевать.. я не знаю как найти силы двигаться дальше.. простить себя и его.. ведь люди не уходят оттуда, где хорошо.. но я считаю себя теперь ничтожеством.. никому не нужной и неинтересной.. раз ничего так и не получилось.. разбилась моя мечта о семье.. о детях с ним.. все планы были связаны с ним..простите за весь этот сумбур..буду рада хотя бы паре слов .. если кто то откликнется..",

I suffer from mental illness, suffering, despondency, melancholy. Everything seems to be good. The husband works, everything is stable. My daughter is cheerful, beautiful. But there is no joy, no peace. I am a teacher of foreign languages. 3 years ago I worked at a school, and at that time there was a conflict with my mother-in-law. I offended her. She went to her sister. The housing issue is to blame. I couldn't get along with her. And - right after this quarrel - I felt like dying. Panic attacks. At work, I pulled the strap, took sick leave. I drank pills all the time. Tranquilizers. My husband, my mother, everyone turned away. Well, that is, I was alone at that time. There was once a moment of a fit of fear. I went to the mental dispensary. They said - get treatment. It was not treated for long, 8 days. They gave a bunch of pills (but I did not drink them), they gave one injection. There was a feeling - go confess, commune. And so she did. I asked my mother-in-law for forgiveness. My husband took out a mortgage, now we are three of us. But I never became the same. I'm afraid to work, I'm afraid of heavy loads. There was no money at all. I sit and cry. I was completely different. I flew to France, to Turkey. Now I'm vegetating. I don't feel love from my husband, but I feel like a food processor. And it seems like I fell into a trap. The thoughts are terrible. Cut yourself up. It happens that I look (...) and it becomes so good. And I will look at my relatives, remember my lack of money, and again longing.",

But I have a father, he does not allow me to have a dog, and indeed, he hates cats. I even think he will support me, but I don't need it. After all, I am still, quite a child, but I want to die.

1,"На данный момент мне 25 лет.

Какая у меня цель в жизни предназначена? И самый главный - за что такое наказание как я, моей маме которая так хотела ребёнка, которая билась как рыба об лед лишь бы сыночек жил в сухости тепле и сытости, а я даже не могу обнять ее и сказать я тебя люблю и по просить прощения за всё....очень часто плачу по этому поводу, плакать у меня лучше всего получается, не имею собственного мнения, суеверный, то верю в бога то нет, все эти мысли со временем затихают но потом раскрываются опять и с большей силой, всё идёт под откос, не знаю что вообще мне делать, просто плачу и думаю о том какая кара меня ждёт в дальнейшем за всё содеянное, чувствую себя полнейшим отбросом изза своего образа жизни, поплакаться некому, столко боли скопилось, знаю что загнию один без поддержки, с детства сижу за компьютером, люблю играть, потому что отвлекаюсь и забываю обо всех внешних реальных проблемах....в общем не знаю как дальше жить и как побороть себя, выбраться из замкнутого колеса которое уверенно катиться на самое дно, мне тошно от себя, осознавая какой я прогнивший...все 25 лет жизнь прогибала меня, преподнося всё новые и сложные испытания лично для меня, но я не становился сильнее а всё больше утопал в болоте собственных страхов и проблем, часть того чего хотелось бы высказать уже не вспомню, хотя хочется в полной мере и во всех красках рассказать о том что со мной твориться.... много чего произошло, мне просто страшно и одинокого, меня врят ли кто поймёт, постоянная смена настроения, накручивающиеся комом проблемы вгоняют меня в глубокую депрессию, я тупо запутался и не знаю как надо правильно жить...",

How can you live in this world where everyone is using you, betraying, cheating? I already have no strength",
1,"Здравствуйте. Меня зовут Александр. Мне 23 года. У меня в настоящее время сложилась достаточно сложная ситуация. По крайней мере так кажется мне.. Дело в том что я суицидально настроенный человек. В последние 2 года я думаю о суициде буквально каждый день.. За эти два года в буквальном смысле не было не одного дня чтобы я об этом не думал. Дело в том ,что детство и последующее взросление у меня сложилось мягко говоря нелёгкое.. Я не хочу говорить обо всём ,но некоторые моменты я могу раскрыть. Я не помню моменты раньше 6ти летнего возраста. Поэтому буду говорить начиная с того возраста.. В детстве у меня были и мама и папа,но с ними я не жил. Они разошлись,когда мне было 5. Я жил у бабушки. Квартира бабушки находилась напротив их квартиры. Мать ушла жить к своей матери.. Оба моих родителей страдали(страдают) алкоголизмом. Вопросами моего существования занималась бабушка.Кормила бабушка,одежду тоже давала бабушка. Так как родители разошлись,отец остался жить напротив бабушки. Т.е рядом со мной. Отец мой -агрессивный человек. Вплоть до окончания школы,жизнь у меня была не сахар. Он избивал и бабушку и меня.. Прекратилось это когда мне исполнилось 14 и я мог дать сдачи.. в это же время мама у меня умерла от цироза. никакого расстройства я не испытал.. и если честно мне до сих пор всё равно. Отца своего я ненавижу.. А на мать мне всегда было плевать.Так как в детстве она не проявляла рвения со мной общаться. В школе я был изгоем. Меня обзывали ,избивали. Преподавателям было плевать.. Они никогда не пытались это поменять. А жаловаться я им не мог. Боялся что станет хуже.Хотя они и сами всё видели,но ничего не делали..Я живу в посёлке и поэтому все знали ,кто мои родители и видимо было предубеждение ,что я не лучше.. Отношение ко мне начало меняться только ,когда я был в старших классах. Жил я у Бабушки.Отношения с ней формальные. Семейных взаимоотношений никогда не было. Я жил в своём маленьком мире.. Друзей у меня не было. За всю жизнь ни одного. одиночество сильно давило.. Но в тоже время мне никто не был нужен.. В 15 лет была попытка суицида.. Я пытался её скрыть,но начались осложнения и на скорой я загремел в больницу,где с дуру, в конце концов признался в попытке суицида. Потом моего отца лиши Род прав. Опеку после долгих уговоров и определённых условий взяла бабушка.. Я не хотел в детский дом и предложил отдавать большую часть пособия бабушки,чтобы меня не сдали туда. Были и другие условия ,но это отдельная тема. В школе я доучился. Так как вся жизнь была каким то недрозумением,я никогда не думал о том что мне делать дальше.. не думал где я буду жить...ведь жилья у меня собственного не было) я поступил в университет. просто наугад. сиротский статус позволял поступить куда хочу.. но мне было плевать. Профессия мне не подходила.. учился с горем пополам. 2 года проучился и после нервного срыва угодил в больницу. в психиатрическую. Душевное или как говорят психологическое состояние после больницы ухудшилось в сотни раз.. таблетки смогли расшатать и так уже расшатанное.. В итоге я бросил учёбу и вернуться мне уже не удастся.. да я и не собираюсь. после того как бросил прошло 2 года.. год назад была попытка суицида. опять неудачная.. промучался я около месяца от последствий.. И СЕЙЧАС я понимаю.. детство у меня не сложилось.друзей у меня нет. мне без них плохо и в тоже время я не уверен что мне нужны люди. Мизантропия достигла пика. Каждый человек вызывает раздражение. даже тот кого я в первый раз вижу в окне. Семьи мне не видать.. да и скорее всего вряд ли это было бы возможно если бы у меня было всё хорошо.. Отношений у меня ни с кем не было.. да и вряд ли могли бы быть.. Дело в том что я человек с нетрадиционной ориентацией . На 100% я уверен быть в этом не могу.. но Я думаю что так и есть. А отношение общества к таким людям сложное. Также у меня нет жилья.. После того как я ушёл из университета живу я в социальном жилье. ноутбук полуразломанный... пользуюсь соседским вай фаем.. пока они не додумаются поставить пароль..Доходом у меня нет... я не работаю.. деньги трачу которые успел накопить пока считался сиротой и платили пособия.. Деньги скоро кончаться ..и тогда я окажусь на улице и без еды. Я страдаю крайней степенью социофобии.. С глазу на глаз я не умею ни с кем разговаривать. Я буквально боюсь людей и стараюсь к ним не подходить. на улицу тоже не выхожу.. Приступы паники и дрожи сильно мучают. головная боль не проходит месяцами. Врачей я не люблю. и к ним я не пойду. В больнице ставили диагнозы Соиальные фобии, пролонгированная депрессивная реакция с расстройство адаптации,писали Биполярное расстройство,расстройство личности смешанного типа. ",

Is my whole life now a solid black stripe?",
1,I have a wonderful child,
1,", I don't know what to do. I want to commit suicide! I can't find a job. Today I spent my last money on bread, potatoes and pasta. I am 31 years old, I have a first grader son. There are many vacancies. But almost nothing suits me, because I live with my child alone. Because of the school and the fact that I have no one to help, I am very limited in my choice of work - I need a place from 9.00 to 17.00. And there are almost no such vacancies. Basically it is a 2/2 floating weekend. You can, of course, say that it would be good for me to find a nanny to take him to school and pick him up and sit with him while I am at work. But the prices for nannies are such that the entire salary will be spent on this with such a schedule. And finding some kind of grandmother for this is also not an option, because it is our pensioners who earn extra money, and their prices are not lower than the average in this area. The places that suit me according to the schedule are located in other parts of the city, where I simply won't physically be in time in the morning. And at the interview, first of all, they ask what I am going to do when my son is ill or on vacation. I agree to any job, even for a minimal payment, as long as there is something to buy food. But for two months now I have not been able to find anything. How can mothers live in this country? The ex-husband does not pay child support and does not help in any way. To get my son into first grade, I have not paid for the last few months for a room (we are renting in a hostel), now they are threatening to evict us if I don’t pay by Friday. I do not know what to do. I was looking for a part-time job on the Internet, but I have no IT skills. And everything else is most often a scam. I'm so desperate! I know that it is possible to send a child to an orphanage for a while (for six months), due to family difficulties, until I improve my financial situation. But then again, how do you explain this to a 7-year-old child? How to tell him about it? No matter how you explain it, it will still be a lifelong trauma. And again, well, I'll give it to you for six months. Well, I'll find a job, and six months will pass, and I'll have to leave, because the schedule will again be inappropriate. So if you give it away, then I'm afraid forever. And I don't even want to think about it. More and more often thoughts of suicide come, the only thing that still holds is a child. But it cannot go on that long. We will have nothing to eat this week. No help from anyone. I went to the mothers help center at the church. She asked for money to pay the debt for housing. They told me that they don't help with money. Then I asked the priest to talk to the parishioners, can someone help sit with the child, so that I can finally find a job. 2 weeks after the sermon, the priest made this request to the people, no one wanted to help. I do not already know where to go and what to do!",
1,I had a hysterics because of which I want to die.,

This is how I cry my life every day I just want to know the opinions of others",
1,"I'm tired of life. Although my life has never been easy, there was always hope for the best. From the age of 13 I was covered with acne, everything looked so terrible that one day some grandmother, seeing me on the street, crossed herself. The school teased me. But she reassured herself that everything would be fine. I entered the university that my dad chose. Specialty - ecologist. Dad was sure that he would give me a good job, his friend just worked in an environmental organization. I wanted to go to honey. college, but you can't argue with your father. But when I was in my 4th year, my dad died. What can I say, with my honors degree in ecology, I couldn't find a job for six months. Then I found it not in my specialty. I have 2 more brothers, the youngest was only 7 years old 2 weeks before his father's death. I live for them. My mother kicked me out of the house so that I would not interfere with her driving the men. I don't understand why I live, I have neither a husband nor children. While my peers were getting to know guys and getting married, I walked around covered in pimples and caused only disgust. Yes, now at 31, I do not have this problem, but there are no normal free men of my age, everyone is married. I am very tired of being alone. And I see no reason to continue living.",
1,"She left me. I am a finished creature. I continue to love her very much, she is a very good and kind person, but she could not love me. I don’t know what to do, today I lit a cigarette, this is me, the one who hasn’t drunk and smoked all my life and despised all this ... Lord, forgive me for everything, I was wrong, I am to blame for that, but it hurts so much, I don’t want to live, I have lost all sense of what to do, it’s so hard for me. I still remember how we spent time together and it strangles, kills me, my hands are shaking like an old man. What if she has someone else? he caresses her, hugs her, touches her naked body ... God my heart is breaking with pain! This has been going on for a month now, I pray that she will come back to me, send me sms, messages about the petition, I will really change, I will become someone you can love, but just come back to me! I love her more than life, Lord forgive me for everything, help me to cope with all this, I can not stand it.",

Yes, there is one guy that I really like, but who needs a piece of bacon?",
1,"I'm tired of life, my parents tell me to learn, but how can I learn, they also killed my studies. I used to do my homework every day and studied perfectly well, went to the computer rooms because of the computer they started beating me and I lost my life goals and lost my future profession. It is very difficult for me to study now, I was driven by thoughts about the future, that I will not have it all the same. I'm tired of this life and I decided to kill myself. Up to this point, I tried to kill myself so many times, but I could not. My family always speaks behind me and does not even say it in my face.",
1,Hey. My name is Maxim and I want to commit suicide.,
1,"I'm tired of everything. I'm tired of poverty. There is no work, as well as higher education, recently I went to design courses in order to get a profession. I try to learn, but deep down I don't believe that anything will come of it. It seems to me that I will receive my certificate and the maximum that it will serve me is to put it in a frame and admire it. And I will never get out of my swamp. I’m tired of my house, which looks little better than a barn, which is always damp and cold and there is nowhere to properly wash. Tired of walking for a year in the same shoes and not being able to afford everything that my peers can afford. I’m a pretty girl, but who’s going to look at someone with an ever-depressed expression on his face? Both acquaintances and strangers always tell me that I am sad, and I have already got used to it. There is no one to expect support from, my mother helps as much as she can, but I still feel nothing will come of this study. She said, if it doesn’t work out, then don’t expect any more help from her, and I think that it will be so. I had many plans and hobbies, but none of this I can do. Because everything comes down to money, whatever one may say. Do you want to write electronic music and play an instrument? Yes, it's my dream. But for this, buy a good instrument, not this log of yours, buy a normal computer that will allow you to write this very music without freezing every second. Buy headphones, an audio system, and so on and so forth. The list is endless. For whatever you take - everything depends on this damn money. In relationships, exactly the same unlucky. Recently, it turned out that my beloved person was simply using me as a temporary option. And I, no matter how logical my arguments are, no matter how I try to convince myself that all this needs to be endured, I am still in apathy with self-esteem tending to zero. All my relationships, including this one, have always been dependent. I made a man my world, and when this man left, he seemed to take my whole life with him. Naturally, I was depressed for months, consoling myself with alcohol and now and then trying to ""explain"" everything to myself and stop thinking about it. No matter how hard I try, I guess I just don't love myself. And neither the article nor self-persuasion helped me in this. I always do everything with an eye on the person who seems to me better than me. That's the same with the former. All my photos, all my activities, all my thoughts seemed to spite him, as if I were trying to prove to him who he had lost. Even though I know that he doesn't even remember me. I just don't know how to do something for myself and have lost all remnants of motivation. Probably just out of luck. All that remains is either to live a hated life and shove your dreams to hell, or to stop it all. I do not believe that the best is yet to come, as I have already noticed that every year of life becomes only worse than the previous one.",

I don't even know where to start, maybe I just have no luck in life. maybe this is my fate, I can't bring my life back to normal, it still doesn't work out, I separated from my husband two years ago, and now I'm alone, although there are those who like me, but I don't have a relationship, my daughter goes to first grade. work ... it's hard with work, all around deception, count it for free a couple of times, but I try, at least to give my daughter everything I need, but a year ago an idea struck me. that in life I don't see any more meaning, everything is gray and everyday, I'm tired of dragging out my miserable existence, and I don't want to live anymore, all my life I have only torment (since childhood I have problems with teeth, treatment did not help at all, and recently I just had crowns, the amount for their treatment I just can't collect about 100,000 thousand for the entire jaw, but I don't want to be so disgusting, it hurts to be unnecessary for anyone, without someone who will calm down when it doesn't add up, as if I shouldn't was born. and no one made plans for my life (although this is a fact. I should not have been) and now, in a month I am 30, I just do not know where to find the strength to live further, and does it make sense in all this? in this world I am absolutely alone, nothing has been given to me, my mother has died. dad is indifferent to my life, not love, no care, not beauty, no talents, only one small ray to which I can not give anything ... just tired. wildly tired ...",

1,"I don't want to live, I am a victim of my parents' overprotection. I have completely lack of social skills and the correct understanding of the world around me. In addition to all this, I am also an energy vampire, I like when other people suffer. In addition to all this, I have no feelings for many things, I generally keep quiet about love. My tows are similar to small children, I want to buy this for me, I also feel that everyone owes me everything and everything at once. Not life, but a fairy tale would have been said by many, but this fairy tale was in childhood, and now it looks more like hellish torments of overcoming oneself, and to be honest, it does not work. Something not good is seething inside me, constant comparison of myself with someone, excessive self-praise, daily searching for excuses and blaming others, I am also very trusting and naive and greedy. Yes, an interesting thing, I do not feel the time, for example, not understanding when to get a haircut or wash, since there is no such thing with brushing your teeth. My soul hurts, my body does not want anything, and my brain insists that nothing will work out for you and that it really doesn’t work.

1,"Since childhood, I grew up as a timid, modest, uncommunicative and impressionable child. In that teenage age, when some difficulties arose, I often convinced myself: I will grow up and everything will change. And so I grew up. Due to several traumatic events in my childhood, I lived according to the principle: never to be attached to anyone. In particular (at that time) it concerned my friends (I was always grateful to my parents for everything, and although they were divorced for about 10 years, and then got back together, I endured it without any difficulties). At the age of 20-25, I made a sufficient number of friends (friends at the place of residence, friends at school). I lived alone, my friends were also young and often liked to gather with me. With or without friends, but I was not bored alone at that time (from the age of 15 I lived separately from my parents as a student, and then I got a job and rented my own apartment). Loneliness was a joy to me. I was not bored, I could always find something to do without even leaving home. Relations with the opposite sex are not that they did not go well, I simply did not really look for them, since I did not know how to build a dialogue with the opposite sex, although the girls paid attention to me. And then the moment came when I connected my life with a girl. I will say right away - she was my dream. I have been waiting for our relationship for 3 years. Then we lived in a civil marriage for 1 year, and then another 4 years in marriage. During the time that we were married, we had a child who turned 3 years old. My wife didn’t have any friends, she was neutral. Since I was the first of all my friends to get married, the connection with me as a person who devoted himself to his family faded a little. And as a result, friends turned into acquaintances (and they themselves soon all got families and all left wherever). I experienced the loss of friends with a little regret, because I had the most precious thing - my family. Time passed, we lived with my wife. The passion of the first years passed, everyday problems often came to the fore, but even in the most difficult moment of misunderstanding between us, I thanked God for my spouse, child and family. But it all ends someday, so family happiness has come to an end. I learned about my wife's betrayal. How unfaithful she was to me, I did not delve into the question - my nerves were not iron, but the fact that she fell in love with another person did not require proof (although there was evidence of treason). I did not restrain my wife, I realized that I really love the other and they have mutual feelings. As a result - the third extra, I was left without a wife and without a child I adore. The wife left with the child, divorce. It turned out that living alone is now an impossible task for me. Having lived together for so many years and then like this - alone, I am completely beyond my powers. Sometimes a day is normal - I try to calm myself down, switch to something, another day - even like a wolf howl, melancholy finishes, a terrible depression, apathy piles on. And after all, you know, life doesn't end there, but ... and I wouldn't be here if I hadn't typed in the browser search: ""I'm tired of life ..."" Actually, that's how I ended up on this site.",

Once I told her during our next quarrel that I did not want to live, and she said that I would do everyone a great service. I am so jealous of the people my mother really loves and she supports them.

All close relationships are falling apart, it is so difficult to meet a loved one and so easily they turn away from me. I’m already just afraid of relationships, and on the other hand, sometimes it directly drives me from loneliness. My son is 12 years old and that he only sees that mom is constantly left alone. I don't share this with him, but he can see it anyway. Of course, thanks to him, my life is not so lonely, but this is wrong, he is a son, he should not replace my whole family.

A drunken husband is very aggressive, it is impossible to please him with anything. It takes out the whole soul. From relatives I have a son and a younger cousin. The son is an adult, he lives with his wife separately. I told my husband that I would complain to my son, so he promised to beat me so that it would not seem a little. Yes, and in front of the son's wife, it is a shame, she does not know, they are recently married. She has a very good family, parents are not drinking at all and are friendly.

I'm used to not sharing anything with her. It's okay, in principle. There are, of course, exceptions. On holidays or just when we are in a good mood, we can joke, laugh, and chat about everything in the world, but this happens very rarely. Big quarrels rarely happen. But when they happen, they knock me out of the rut, I think her, too. Today is such a day. We fought right in front of everyone at the very entrance to the shopping center. God, how angry I was at that moment. And how devastated now from the evil words released to me. What caused it? We could not decide on the choice of a bag. Idiocy?! Oh yeah. The phrase stuck in my head: ""Take your passport and get out of the house, I don't want to see you."" And it would be okay if I was rude to her or something. Even though I was harsh, I said that she should not break off at me if she was in a bad mood, because she screamed at her younger brother all evening, then sarcastically in my direction. After that, accusations were sent that I did not value anything, because she bought all the things for her own money (I am 20 years old, I am still studying, I don’t earn money yet). But what does this have to do with it ?! And I appreciate everything! But how to say at least thank you to a person when he twitches, frowns, sighs and, in general, shows with his whole appearance that he is dissatisfied. In the end, I exploded and said that I shouldn't behave like that. And then it started ... I don't appreciate her, I don't love her. Someone's daughter buys everything for herself and adores her mother. Naturally, I was not silent, I said that she was talking nonsense now, that I was not talking about money at all. And after that she told me to get out of the house. Of course she won't kick me out. Of course, all this is said out of spite. But these words hurt me so much. And I cannot tell her about it, because she will sincerely believe that I am to blame myself. And that I deserve this attitude towards myself. I always thought about moving to another city after graduation, but now this thought does not make me happy either. Complete apathy. I want to die, but I don’t have the courage to do something with myself, I want to be hit by a car or someone attacked me.

When her salary was raised, she bought all the money for travel, at that time I was 4 years old, every vacation she spent without me. In fact, I grew up without parents, my grandmother, because of this, I often quarreled with my mother, but I could not do anything.

When I was 7 years old my sister was born, and they completely forgot about me. I treat my sister very well, I understand that she is not to blame for anything.

Now, the relationship has become a little better, but still, I do not feel any care and warmth towards me. With my younger sister, she travels everywhere, every day she says that she loves her very much, I still do not notice me. She tells me that she feeds me and dresses me, but she is not obliged to do another. Recently, my friends betrayed me, and I was left alone. About this, she said that I was a fool, and should go and make peace with them, because (according to her) no one wants to communicate with such a stupid one as me. For all my achievements, she does not praise me, I am an excellent student, I take first places in regional Olympiads, I play the piano, but she says that every fool can do this, and when my sister does something, she says that she is great, not like me. Sometimes during quarrels, she screams out that she does not love me. If I had the opportunity, I would leave home, but I have nowhere to go. I don't know what to do, what is wrong with me.

Throughout my pregnancy, I have been under terrible stress, and now it has come to the point that I want to commit suicide. She is to blame for everything, for everything. She drove herself into a dead end. The problem is that I dated a man for 3 years, performed 2 abortions from him, undermined my women's health, I was sure that we were about to part. After the second abortion, I made the final decision to part with him, but he crawled on his knees and begged me not to leave him, and well, I broke down and continued my relationship with him, although I knew it was a big mistake. I was not going to connect life with him, but for some reason I continued to meet and spend my precious years on him.

It was simply deadly for me, since the third abortion would have been too much, I hid it from everyone for a long time, went - I thought what to do. As a result, at the 3rd month of pregnancy, she told him and her parents. Bottom line: they had a wedding, I moved in with him and the most ""fun"" began - a complete lack of money and a huge debt hole. I am unemployed, he works for a penny seven days a week, and pays all the salary for loans. It happens that there is no money even for travel.

I wanted to go to college, but my mother was against it - she had a fixed idea for me to have a higher education, so she said to prepare for entering the next year. We chose humanitarian subjects to make it easier. It was still very difficult for me to prepare, because from hormones, even though I don't drink them now, but all the same, my head began to think worse and my memory became bad. I passed the USE average, I didn’t stretch it for the budget, I know that my abilities are very mediocre, so I went to the simplest university, to the easiest, stupid compared to others, humanitarian specialty, which will not give any guarantee of earnings, although my mother and I live very modestly, dad helped and said that he would help with tuition fees, but he has his own problems and his own family. I didn't go to the evening because I would have to return home after midnight, and my mother is worried, her health is weak herself - heart problems, grandparents are old, my aunt lives with them, an invalid, does not walk, and the blockage of the exam seriously knocked her down now I try not to disturb her. Mom was very happy when I entered and received a student's student, she had a holiday that day, she said that I would definitely find new friends, my life would change, but ... it's hard for me to realize that my peers are already in their 3rd year of study , many are working and have achieved something, but at my age I just entered and it is not known yet whether I can finish? Sometimes a strong melancholy will roll over, of course, I try not to give in, but each time it is more and more difficult ...",

It was even hard for me to communicate on Skype, because because of the face, in general, we talked to him 37 said that he would come in October, then he disappeared, I began to write myself, I began to take the initiative, then I wrote that I didn't like it and tell me, you had a fight, I wrote to him that he is a mama's son, at 37 he lives with his mother, he said that he had lost interest in me and said ""God help you in finding a husband.""

Mom said that I don't need to get married, that a man needs a healthy woman, but as a normal person I can't get up and immediately go to the kitchen and cook or just drink tea, I need to get up EARLY to treat my face, put on my lenses, today the bleeding has opened, everything poured on the floor, while I cleaned the bed, the morning went by with psychos.

1,". I would like to tell my story. I am 20 years old and every day I think about suicide, because I have absolutely nothing in my life. The fact is that from early childhood my parents took too much care of me, overly praised and took care of me. At the moment I am studying at a university and only now I understand that I myself cannot understand any life situation, everywhere I am looking for a question or advice from the outside, that's right in every simple matter. I believe that there is no point in living like this without my opinion and there is no point in living like this, because a man at my age should be able to stand up for himself, understand at least something, and I just take offense at most everything that is said in my direction. Whatever I undertake, even if it will later turn out well for me, I still give up this business after a while, perhaps it is the fault of the part of the computer that I have been sitting at since I was 10, but only now I decided to give it up ... Also, lately, all my former acquaintances and friends are gradually moving away from me, and I think this is due to the fact that I have no interest in anything in life, I don't even know what to do next. When I try to tell them something, no one really listens to me, and when others speak, I delve into it and take it too close to my heart. Summing up, I want to say only one thing, do not play at the computer as much as I played it (from 10 to 20 years old)",

I waited for him for a year from the army ""as a friend"", but I constantly told him that I have feelings and I would not betray him with my body either, because I love and cannot betray my feelings. He said that he believed, after the army he came and confessed love, said that we will be together. After the first sex, he changed, stopped showing signs of attention and later wrote ""you are the same as everyone else, I never believed you, because you are beautiful!"" It turned out that he was twice in love with beautiful girls, the second of them was generally a porn photo model and they betrayed him. But why is he taking revenge on me? What is my fault? I can’t cry anymore .. I don’t understand what’s going on .. I want to die because I was sincere with him, I put my soul into this relationship, I believed that he was the one who would appreciate my loyalty and love, everything was so good .. And he insulted me just because I was born with a beautiful face? I was never proud of this, I do not consider myself directly beautiful, just an ordinary face, not crooked but ordinary, on the contrary, I always aspired to study, received 2 educations so that my boyfriend would be proud of me ..

1,". I'm 16 years old. I'm in 11th grade. My problem is that I don’t want anything. At all. I have no hobbies, I don’t like anything. Therefore, I don’t know who to study. Before, choosing a profession, I was looking for the best option in terms of salary (the higher salary, the more this specialty attracted me). At first I wanted to be a doctor, but then I realized that I didn’t like working with people, and for some reason I hated this profession, then I wanted to become a lawyer, but still doubted. And despite this, I decided to take the Unified State Exam in history and social studies. But I changed my mind again, because this job scares me (I was told that after a lost case, one lawyer was stabbed to death with his family. Yes, yes, I am also a coward). At the end of the 10th grade, for some reason I chose more specialized mathematics (in general, I hoped to become a programmer, but nothing shines for me there). Having suffered a severe depression during the summer holidays (I am still in it, to be honest), I realized that nothing attracted me, I began to be afraid of people. Even though I want to love my job and work not with grief in half, I DON'T KNOW WHOM TO GO TO LEARN ON. Even if I go somewhere, I am afraid that later I will not work in my specialty. All my classmates have already decided, they walk happy. And I have no purpose in life. I do not know what to do after school. This thought depresses me. I have no talents, nature even cheated me with my appearance. I am very nervous and depressed, and also with low self-esteem. And besides, all my life without friends. I don’t want to sit on my parents’s neck. However, I don’t want to get married. I don’t know how to live, what to become. I don’t know what I want. Suicide attempts were, yes. But in the time of depression. Recently I have not been happy. My mother tells me that this is all because I am lazy (and you can’t argue) Although I study well, and the assignments that I am given on time. I just want to lie down. and not wake up.

1,"История банальна. Замуж вышла 6 лет назад. 4 года не получалось забеременеть.  Удалось стать мамой только благодаря эко. Конфликты в семье появились сразу после брака. Уже тогда задумалась о разводе,  но все надеялась на лучшее. Муж работящий, без вп, но ужасный зануда. Из за неправильной, по его мнению,  загрузки стиральной машины может устроить скандал.  Потом умер мой отец. Через год – мама. Брата не стало еще раньше в 2007 году. Состояние ужасное. Осталась абсолютно одна.  Спустя 2 года сделали эко и родился сын. В период беременности муж постоянно унижал, я плакала. Но уйти не могла, своего жилья не было, квартира в ипотеке, родни нет. Малыш родился капризным, в первые 1.5 м я почти выпала из жизни. Поддержки никакой, муж работал с первого же дня, как привез нас из роддома. На работе ему отказали взять  выходные. После кесарево было очень тяжело, ребенок ужасно нервный, крики круглые сутки. Ничего не могу сказать  - после работы муж всегда помогал в чем нужно, если позволяла возможность  - приезжал с работы в течение дня,  чтобы я могла элементарно покушать и сходить в душ. Когда сыну исполнилось полгода, мы решили поменять пмж. Планы были давно, но тут ситуация обострилась тем, что после декрета мне бы пришлось выйти на другую работу, ипотека – долг. Мы продали квартиру и уехали в другой регион, поближе к его родителям.  На оставшиеся от закрытия  ипотеки деньги купили хорошую квартиру, пусть не в новом доме, но все же. Муж нашел работу быстро. Хочу заметить, что смена работы для него в порядке вещей – он очень конфликтный..По его мнению, виновата я. Это мне мало зарплаты, хотя он действительно получает всегда мало, при наличии кредита у нас просто не оставалось денег ни на что, едва дотягивали до зарплаты.  На новом месте жительства проблемы остались прежними  - каждодневная ссора. Крики с его стороны. По его мнению, я не уважаю его и не считаюсь с его мнением, я корыстная и мне всегда мало денег.  Я круглые сутки с ребенком. Выйти и сходить куда то кроме магазина не могу. Муж возмущается, что сын с ним беспокойный и он не справляется. Пока он на работе, я круглые сутки с ребенком. Малыш беспокойный,  все время на взводе, не скажу, что устала физически, но морально просто убита. Материнство не радует. Денег нет даже сходить в салон красоты или купить новые вещи или книгу. За каждую покупку муж отчитывает, что я живу не по средствам, хотя я получаю неплохие декретные. Каждый день слышу упреки в свой адрес, оскорбления и унижения..Не уважаю его как мужчину, презираю. Но куда уйти – не знаю. Грозит в случае развода отнять ребенка  (в юр. вопросах он хорошо подкован), тем, что убьет меня, но жить буду с ним. Интима нет очень давно..Как мужчина он мне противен. Удовольствия не получаю, да и морально не могу его подпустить. Сын растет в нездоровой обстановке. Это еще сильнее гнетет меня. Говорить не получается . Он сразу переходит на крик. Нас уже знают все новые соседи из за постоянных оров.  К психологу идти не хочет, говорит, что тут и без психолога ясно – я его не уважаю, я вижу корнем всех проблем его и так далее..Я не могу уважать истеричку, увы. Куда уйти с сыном? У меня никого нет.В новом городе даже нет работы теперь. Кризисных центров тоже нет. У подруг своя жизнь, свои заботы, да и я не люблю выносить сор из избы. Виню себя за то, что живу с таким человеком  Что сын вынужден расти в такой обстановке. Знаю, что виновата сама, и от этого еще больнее. Иногда просто хочу покончить с собой, но думаю о сыне и не могу решиться, хотя уже все спланировала. Как быть и куда пойти  - не знаю.",

I am on antidepressants because I cannot forget for a minute that I did this. Is it really going to torment me all my life? How can you forgive yourself for these mistakes? How to behave with a guy - tell or keep quiet? Sometimes it seems that it will become easier for me if I confess, but I just cannot tell this, but I'm not sure that I will last long.

I knew that she was a very complicated person, he had not introduced me to her for five years, only gifts were exchanged in absentia. He warned that if we moved to her, it would be difficult. And me - oh well, everything will be fine, but you won't have to pay for housing. Lack of sleep, fatigue, the child is very small - and the fact that I hung the rag in the wrong place, that I put the cup in the wrong place, the eternal dirt that I have to clean up alone, the graters in the kitchen because of the next garbage, her constant desire to humiliate me: and her leg is more graceful, and her height is taller, and she cooks better ... And I explode, start yelling to get behind, she yells that I’m on their neck in her apartment and to roll away. The guy freaks out and yells. Beauty.

1,"I have already tried so many times to write here to express my thoughts in a weighty manner, but it didn’t work. Until that moment, until she left far away from her parents, friends, relatives. The days saturated with a new country were replaced by night tantrums for no reason. I just wanted to cry. Now I understood what the matter was. Looking with the naked eye, we can say that my life has developed well: a job that I like, studying in my favorite specialty, and other things that could identify my social role as successful. But here we must not forget about the human factor ... I am insanely lonely in a foreign country. During the day I run to work, and in the evening I reluctantly return home, because no one is waiting for me like that. I live in a hostel, and before I was saved by the fact that there was a friend next to me. But now she has moved, and we hardly see each other. Only at work - my salvation from not suicide. I am in a state of constant aching feeling of hopelessness and fear of being left alone. Added to it is the factor that I really feel like a worthless person. There is no success either in school or in personal life. My specialty is very cool and promising, but I cannot gather myself together and start to study normally. I study almost the worst of all, although, as I said, it is interesting to me, but I cannot find an incentive. As for my personal life, I don't even try to build anything, because even if I like someone, I don't even try. I do not believe that someone can fall in love with someone like me, because I feel disgust for myself both to external factors and to internal ones. I'm insecure, clumsy, and often stupid. Trying to fix it and concentrating on it makes it even more insecure. Sometimes it seems to me that I am too weak for this world, and that I will not cope with the tasks that are in store for me, because I often do not even care about some things in my everyday life because I believe that nothing will change.",

I told her yesterday that if you don't like me, then get rid of me, to which she replied so that I get rid of myself. She tells me that I am tired of her with these conversations about suicide.

At school I study poorly, I practically do not know anything, it is not even clear how I will pass the exams in the 9th grade, which I am already transferring to. I am almost sure that it is unrealistic to prepare in a year. If I don't give up, it will be a cross on my future. In general, I am categorically against suicide, but in my case there is no way out.

In one of his such spree (at that time there were 3 years of marriage and one daughter), he went to another. I got a job, continued to live as best I could at a new job, I met a guy Love at first sight, there was no need for sex, we could hurt for hours kissing holding hands even while driving. Then I understood what mutual love is. Time passed and we parted from the religious views of his parents, although it was not very easy. Over time, the husband returned (walked for a walk) got along with him from my daughter, after a while I saw that guy with a girl, realizing that he was doing well, without hesitation, gathered with his family and left for another country in order to forget gave birth to a second daughter. Watching him from afar. They returned to their homeland again. The husband found a young girl of 22 years old, went to her and married. I stayed with two children. And one March morning I ran to work with pieces of paper down the street and saw him the very one she loved for 6 years, watching from afar. We met, he hugged him and pressed him and from that moment on, he never let go of us, we were together all the time, if not close, then on the phone and video calls. But 8 months of happiness did not last long. He got into a car accident . For 2 months I was paled, I was next to work to see him in the hospital, spent the night money for the operation, collected, did not leave him encouraging. But alas, he was gone, I don’t know how I survived it, I couldn’t breathe, and for almost a year everyone was saying find a man you should be happy children need a father, they even introduced a guy to start dating even feelings woke up entrusted the children to him with the parents introduced him to the house led. And he morally kills me with words, actions can, because of one of my wrong words, leave and disappear for 3 days without picking up the phone. Yesterday he said that we were parting. I think he had someone, he even wrote down my name on the phone, although it was recorded as my baby. And here I sit and think maybe I'm really a terrible husband, he went out for a walk. Maybe these 8 months of happiness was my destiny. And I will never meet the same ideal someone I love. And how to believe now? How to trust? The husband is now writing again being married to his young one, he writes to me as he misses. Friends of the guy who also betrayed them call they say they don't want to communicate with him that he won't find his parents better than me or come to work supposedly just to find out how things are.

1,"Здравствуйте! Надеюсь кто то здесь сможет помочь так как выбраться из этого состояния в котором я сейчас нахожусь самостоятельно я уже не могу. Ну наверно все по порядку... Скорее всего все мои психологические проблемы идут с детства...Папа ушёл в другую семью когда мне было 7 лет. Родители часто ругались, били посуду, отец приходил пьяный часто. Мама часто плакала, даже при мне пыталась покончить жизнь, включив все конфорки с ГАЗом и отдав мне маленькому ребёнку 7 лет все сбережения со словами "" я не хочу жить езжай к бабушке"" . Естественно я плакала и переубедила маму этого не делать. Затем был подростковый возраст, родители все так же постоянно ссорились когда видели друг друга, отец даже пытался использовать меня чтобы отсудить у мамы часть квартиры...я ему была не нужна... Однажды пришёл пьяный на 9 мая и побил с улицы нам все окна, помню как я сидела в углу и плакала, мне было страшно...мне было уже 9 лет. Я очень рано осознанно повзрослела так как мама много работала, друзей подруг у меня не было так как мама все время пыталась меня ограничить, ей было всегда спокойней чтобы я была рядом, мол подруг настоящих нет, зачем они тебе? Детства как такового у меня не было. И так жила я школа дом, институт дом до 20 лет. Затем я встретила его,Костю,я влюбилась поуши. Он был старше меня на 5 лет, красивый, заботливый, мы все время были вместе. У меня появилось чувство что я живу. У меня было чувство что мы не расстанемся никогда, что этот человек моя судьба. Я готова была для него была на все...но через время начала замечать переписки с другими девушками, общение, мы все меньше времени стали проводить вдвоём, потом начались расставания сначала на неделю, 2 месяца.... Я ждала что он поймёт что то,сделает предложение но он не хотел, я не давила на него. Через 4 года нашей совместной жизни я забеременела...я очень хотела этого малыша, но увидев его реакцию на эту новость поняла - он этого не хочет. Я понимала что если я рожу этого ребёнка я ему его навяжу. И мне пришлось сделать то от чего мучаюсь до сих пор...я сделала аборт, не знаю смогу ли я после этого ещё иметь детей, но мысль о своём поступке терзает до сих пор. Но я не мола поступить иначе...у меня при случае расставания не было ни жилья а идти к маме я бы не смогла так как для меня было самое страшное вернуться домой. Все детство и юность мама скандалила, я не хотела туда возвращаться. Так мы прожили ещё 2 года вместе, на 14 февраля он при наших общих знакомых делает мне предложение, дарит кольцо, я была счастлива...но через 2 месяца он бросает меня из за другой, я собираю все вещи и ухожу...жить не то что не хотелось... Не могу описать я чувствовала себя растоптанной..но я нашла в себе силы, пошла в спортзал.Я проводила там все свободное время после работы, как робот. В итоге через 2 месяца у меня стала идеальная подтянутая фигура. Я и до этого была в порядке, но видимо то что мне надо было отвлечься я очень быстро привела себя в идеальную форму. Через пару месяцев я знакомлюсь с другим парнем, он красиво ухаживает, я пытаюсь забыться. И через 3 мес. Возвращаеться мой Костя, клянёшься в любви и буквально проходу не даёт, делает все чтобы я его простила, я не хотела этого делать, слишком сильная обида уже была, но я понимала что люблю его и я сделала самую ужасную ошибку - я вернулась к нему. Он делает снова предложение, дарит кольцо...  А через пол года когда я заговорила о свадьбе - снова бросает, выгоняет меня со словами "" знаешь я думал я люблю тебя, но я понялчто не люблю"" ... Вот так в общей сложности мы были вместе почти 7 лет. Я ухожу. Я мало помню что было со мной в первые дни, даже месяцы. Пыталась заглушить боль и спортом, пыталась заводить какие то новые отношения, но все тщетно.... Прошёл год и два месяца с тех пор, а я до сих пор его люблю и ненавижу себя за это, но больше ни на кого смотреть не могу. Я понимаю что уже никогда не прощу , но другие мужчины мне стали противны, не могу смотреть на них.Та боль душевная не проходит, а только усиливается, часто думаю о самоубийстве. И мне страшно от этого. У него уже другая девушка, моложе меня. С того дня как мы расстались я его пыталась вернуть первое время... Плакала, звонила, умирала с тоски, но ему было все равно. Сейчас у меня проблемы с работой, у меня свой бизнес, и мне постоянно делают пакости чтобы выжить конкуренты, плюс к этому моя не проходящая дисперсия, я в любой момент вспомнив что то  о прошлом начинаю плакать и камень на груди не проходит. На мужчин смотрю волком, иногда кажеться они меня бояться. Я ни с кем не хочу общаться, подруг у меня как не было так и нет.  Устала бороться, не знаю ради чего просыпаюсь по утрам. Ходила в церковь, но и она мне не помогает. Очень прошу совета что мне делать, так как я понимаю что не могу самостоятельно выбраться из этого состояния, а оно становиться все хуже. Постоянный страх что так и останусь в одиночестве. ",

If euthanasia was legal, I would have agreed to it 7 years ago, and now I understand that I would not regret it even once. I am afraid that if I try to kill myself, with my luck I will only make it worse, paralyze myself and not be able to try again, or fall into a coma and make life difficult for others. but even if I don't try, everything will end up in the hospital, where constant pain awaits me, a huge amount of drugs, devices and tubes under the skin. and all the same loneliness. senseless suffering.

A long nose, and a protruding chin, and even an elongated face. I have wild complexes because of this. Before, I somehow didn't notice, but once a boy at school called me Baba Yaga and I realized that I was really ugly. Complexes and nothing else. I'm afraid to get acquainted myself, but what is there to get to know, just even pass by. I'm afraid they will again say that I am ugly, that they will laugh and humiliate. Yes, I know many unsympathetic girls who have a lot of fans. They are confident in themselves, have forgotten the shortcomings. I can't do that. I cannot believe that I am attractive. There are times when I feel normal, but then abruptly return to normal again. When I go out with my friends, I understand that all the attention goes to them, and I just shade. I'm so tired of this situation. For the second week, I think about suicide.

1,"Трудно писать, мысли все перемешались, в душе пустота, все мое нутро сопротивляется при совершении какого либо действия. Мне 29 лет я с рождения инвалид, диагноз дцп, многое пришлось перенести из за этого но так и не вылечился. Это не очень заметно особенно учитывая то что я научился это скрывать но боли более чем достаточно. В возрасте 13 лет был снят с группы по предположению для того чтобы не ставить на пожизненное но суть не этом. Так вышло что я достаточно рано женился и родилась дочь. Все произошло как то спонтанно, в самом начале наших отношении случилось ужасное, умер отец. Я ее не любил, она просто была рядом поддерживала и из за этого отношения перешли на семью и брак. Спустя 4 года она ушла от меня и забрала ребенка, виной всему стал отчасти быт, было тяжелое время отсутствие работы плюс моя учеба на высшее образование и отчасти как я узнал потом на работе где она  работала в сугубо мужском коллективе поддалась на всеобщие ""ухаживания"". Сходил с ума, лез на стены не знал что делать, не из за нее а из за дочери. Хотел чтобы у ребенка была нормальная полноценная семья но все старания сохранить семью провалились. С начала хотел судиться, сделать все чтобы забрать ребенка но пришлось признать что мать ей нужнее и как бы нибыло больно, остановиться. Находясь в глубокой депрессии спустя всего 3 месяца встретил девушку, все завертелось с немыслимой силой я полюбил ее, появилась вера в жизнь в будущее. Мы сошлись и начали жить в гражданском браке она младше меня на 5 лет. Гонимый этой волной и мечтой о семейной жизни смог за 3 года достичь продвижения в карьере (смена работы затем повышения) но этого было недостаточно.  Маленький городок с очень низкими зарплатами, имея прошлый опыт понимал что для семьи необходимо жилье а стоит оно очень не мало. Все это время она просто сидела дома, пытался ее куда нибудь пристроить чтобы начала что то делать но все тщетно. Меня это не смущало я никогда не сдавался и даже не принимал это как вариант. Готов был для нее на все. Но отношения стали портиться. Она перестала делать вообще что либо даже по дому. Проблемой стало   даже готовка еды и отчуждение в постели. Меня все это время давили и ее и мои родственники чтобы заставлял ее что нибудь делать, но я ее очень сильно любил и немог заставить так как она одной слезой могла сломить, обрушить на повал весь мой суровый дух. Мучаясь в таких условиях я продолжал верить в нее и ждал что еще чуть чуть и она возмется и начнет вместе со мной строить нашу судьбу. Но и сам становился грубее становилось все больше ссор, я не выдерживал давления, давления от тех же родственников, друзей и от самого себя так сильно стремящегося к мечте но не достигшего ее. В какой то момент пришло понимание и решение того что нужно переехать в другой город где будут перспективы и где возможно что то получиться. Тем более эти мысли были очень давно в моей голове еще со студенчества. Но характер мой сдавал а отношения накалялись, сам стал относиться к ней холоднее, стал думать и говорить что нам лучше разойтись (боже о чем я думал, что со мной было, как я мог?) и этот миг настает. Она собирает вещи и уезжает к родителям, мои мысли тогда были что успокоится отдохнет и будем снова вместе. Но все пошло совсем по другому сценарию. Спустя всего несколько дней я узнаю что она села в поезд и поехала к другому и очень далеко за тысячи колометров на юг к черному морю, что достаточно долгое время она за моей спиной общалась с ним в интернете он звал ее к себе и она решилась. Что со мной стало происходить не поддается никакому описанию. Такое предательство, как она могла поступить так со мной, как она могла поступить так с собой отправившись к тому кого она даже не знает, та которую я так любил едет жить и спать с человеком которого даже не знает. Мне было неважно на сколько это унизительно я звонил и пытался ее уговорить чтобы она развернулась и поехала обратно. Но она этого не сделала. Стала говорить что ей все равно, что она ждала что я ее остановлю когда она уезжала а я этого не сделал. Почему то даже после такого предательства, после такого поступка я все равно продолжаю ее любить и не то что есть и спать, даже дышать не могу. Она мне нужна больше жизни. Мой самый близкий друг поддерживал меня все это время и мне это даже немного помогало но в итоге сказал хватит, сказал что его это стало бесить. Теперь я на едине с собой так как не разговариваю об этом со своими родственниками, я просто не могу сказать им что больше не хочу жить. Такого не было никогда. Никогда еще в школьные годы избивали сверстники и считали недочеловеком, ни когда не спал ночами получая новые порции боли от своей болезни. Даже не понимал как могут люди сдаваться, что значит опустились руки и как могут нехотеть жить ведь казалось что все в их руках и если тебе это так сильно надо то возьми, добейся, сделай. Как бы там нибыло я это узнал, я сдался. Просто невижу выхода и хочу смерти. я просто устал. Я устал терпеть всю эту боль,я устал жить и надеется что я чего то смогу добиться, к тому же теперь в этом просто нет смысла. Я никогда не забывал про дочь и всегда старался с ней встречаться как мог, но такой отец как я ей ненужен, что я  могу ей дать? Да и для остальных я обуза со всеми своими проблемами. Хочу освободить всех от себя и освободится сам. Хочу этого так как уже изменить ничего нельзя а продолжать так жить просто немогу. Я совершил самую страшную ошибку в своей жизни, я позволил себе слушать других, слушать их советы а что еще хуже, стал верить этим советам а не самому себе. Ведь мне неважно, была она плохой или хорошей хозяйкой или женой, важно что я ее люблю и считаю что если бы не эта ошибка то все смог бы исправить и быть счастлив. Но уже поздно и ничего нельзя изменить.",

Then it seemed to be oklemalsya and left after grade 9 to college. I study at random. I want to learn, however, I am oppressed by the thought that I am the dumbest person. This greatly hurts my pride, but apparently not so much, since I cannot overpower myself. All my classmates entered the prestigious universities in the world and are happy. They think I'm very dumb and don't even communicate with me. It hurts me terribly. I am lazy to the point of impossible, I cannot tune myself into learning, I just sit down, literally 5 minutes and think about something else. I feel how degraded I am. Although I really love astronomy. Now I have 1 year left in college and that's it. But I set myself up exclusively to study, at least for the last year it is good to unlearn. I just had a bad story 3 years ago when I took psychedelics and I lost my mind. After them, the work of the brain was disrupted .. in general, a complete nightmare. After college I want to go to Russia and study to master, but I understand that I am mediocrity and will not go anywhere .. Why does your country need such idiots as me. But I really have a desire to learn, but it came to me late. It's already very hard for me - life is not developing in the best way, the fact that I am a degenerate is killing me .. I hold on and continue to believe in my strength, but life breaks me, I don't know how long I will be enough. I postponed relationships with guys and replaced them with self-development. I am fixated on this, all summer I have been instilling in myself that it is necessary to study. I don’t know if this will affect my studies or I will continue to grow dull. I realized that I could not solve an elementary problem in mathematics, chemistry, physics, although I really want to study at the Bauman Moscow State Technical University .. but this is unrealistic. As they say, don't jump over your head. I am a nonentity, incapable of anything.

1,"Good afternoon (evening) dear readers I do not know how and where to start. I'm tired of failures, obstacles, I'm writing rather not because I ask for help in salvation, but rather just say I want to there are times when I really want to, but alas, there is no one. there is no desire to burden with their problems. in general, it all probably started from childhood was always very closed with few people communicated could not find the right words. in the family it was decided to grow up as a real man worthy of his parents. lived in the village not in a wealthy family, so I had to work since middle school, but childhood is over, it's time to leave. I understood that I was not ready and I could hardly stay. I could not oppose the principles (always and everywhere to go forward not to wait for help from anyone to cope with everything myself) and it seemed that nothing could hold back. although he coped with everything with great difficulty. the parents became little by little proud. found new acquaintances, developed a principle not to keep friends close. everyone left and now they are leaving, it’s not a pity if they left, then it’s necessary. Received an education. here a little did not work out could not use it. I could not return home as a loser. went to work where you have to earn a living. here it all starts. I met a girl, I don't know how it happened, but it became everything to me. I crossed out everything, gave an impulse to live as I had never lived, to become the happiest, but unfortunately she had another. could not come to terms with it in any way. began to seek. for a year of courtship, I began to understand that I was starting to fade, begged to be with me or to break all ties, but there was neither one nor the other. Apparently it was okay that there was a person next to him that at any time of the day or night he would try to do whatever he wanted. after another three months they began to be in place. happiness did not last long. soon found out that there is still someone like me. life flashed. I understood that I could not be with her and leave her too. after a while, she begged me to forgive and understand what I still cannot understand. Forgiven, began to live, did not see from her the love that he expected in return, or rather, there was no love in return. time passed and quite recently it became clear that all this time he loves another and is drawn to him all. what was waiting in response she gave to another. with me just for the convenience of comfort. it broke me. I don't know what to do next. Nothing has ever slowed down, but then how it happened I understand that this is all stupid and not the last one, but it doesn't make it easier and I don't want others. I thought about death about her and now I think because of my parents and my younger brother. probably didn't do anything. I honestly want peace of mind so tired I already live in a rented apartment with a large company of people where you can only call your bed. sometimes I work for a day. and in my personal life that's what kind of trouble happened.

Women, God, and even parents. I used to be a kind, positive, sociable, decent guy. Sometimes I even went to church (I used to consider myself a believer all my life), but now I have become a haiter and a loser. And all because I am very lonely, I did not have and do not have a serious relationship with the opposite sex (I'm afraid that I will not). It seems not a freak, he always dressed well, well-mannered, polite, well-groomed, and good? Apparently there is no ""core"" (charisma) in me. And so you want pure light love, affection, sex in the end. The girls who I liked simply turned me off, made it clear that they were not going to meet with me. Apart from my first and only ""love"", which deceived me and met in parallel with another. For some reason, if I sometimes liked some person, it was sure to be the one who was completely uninteresting to me. Usually my friends (who are almost all married now) used these to drag them into bed, but I never liked this alignment. I did not want and do not want to use anyone for selfish purposes. Over the past 13 years, I've only had sex with courtesans, and even then rarely. Now someone will say that this is a sin, but I don't see anything wrong with that, I relieve stress in this way, it really becomes easier for a while.",

But the point is, I call it a self-destruction crisis. It has arrived. I understand that nothing is holding me back anymore, and I do not see any ways to please myself or hope. The last few days I just want to do something with myself and have absolutely no idea how I can live on. Or maybe the fact is that the person I love for 4 years now has not answered my calls and messages for six months. Expressing the intention to no longer communicate with me. At that time, he also began to be depressed, but not from parting with me. He made it clear to me that we would never have anything. So that's it. Tomorrow is his birthday and I understand that if I don’t do something for us to make up and (or) he doesn’t answer. Then I can hardly survive it. Because lately the hope that we can be together is the only thing that supported me. At the very beginning of our acquaintance, I became pregnant with him, he was not happy, he was married. (Now not) And he blamed me to make the decision to get rid of the child. Now I regret it, because perhaps now I would have a meaning in life. Recently, hoping for a church, I went to confession and the priest reacted with such anger to this information. He said that because of the abortion, I am not human. And I cannot deserve forgiveness. In general, now the thought of the church does not help me. At work last month I have been working for 3 employees. I get very tired. The salary has not increased. But in general, the state is such that you don't want anything. Live, breathe, eat. I can't even lie down. I can’t do anything. If there was a reliable and quick way to die, I would use it.

1,", I have a situation that makes myself sick and I want to lay hands on myself from remorse. There was never a particularly serious relationship, the guys I liked never reciprocated. Six months ago I met a guy he was 23, I'm 20. We met at a party through mutual friends and when everyone got drunk I slept with this guy on the first day simply because I wanted at least some male attention that he paid me then. I didn’t count on anything, but he suddenly began to continue communicating with me, although it was clear on his part that he didn’t want to and he hinted at it. Then we again walked with the company and slept a second time with him, and after that I realized that I fell in love very much. These are the feelings that I have never experienced with anyone. I think about him all day long. I'm waiting for calls from him, sms. But he calls and writes very rarely, a couple of times a month. We had long conversations, he told me about his life. I don't even understand what he needs, I know about him that he had a huge number of girls and sex for him is no longer so interesting. But nevertheless it seems to me that I am only for this, as a constant partner for sex. When we are together after sex, he shows attention, we fall asleep together, he hugs. And I can’t understand if all this is played or he likes me at least a little. We have fun together. I want to die from the thought that the person I love is using me, and I allow it because I'm afraid of losing him. If I knew that I would fall in love so much, I would give everything to return that evening when we met and fix everything. Now he sees me as an ordinary bum. She says that I am still stupid, small, I do not understand anything in life. We have a small age difference, but he started leading an adult life too early, changing girls, distributing drugs, raising a lot of money. And now he says that he looks at this world and girls differently. It is difficult for him to find a girl who would surprise him, since he has tried every one. Why does he need me? ((((I had only one guy before him and I have no sexual experience, unlike him. And because of this, it's also a shame that he is very experienced in bed, but I can't do anything. a few days ago he wrote that he wanted to come to me. I thought that I could write him ""no"", but I could not again because of fear of losing communication with him, that he would not write again and it would be difficult for me to survive and I agreed. Now I look forward to meeting and I don't know how to behave. I know that we will not be together, if only because he is too cool for me. I am ordinary, but he is insanely handsome and crowds are running after him, some of his ex-girls were beautiful, slender models and from these thoughts everything is torn inside. Now I sit and think about what to do. How to behave when he arrives. Or right now to commit suicide <ed.mod.>, it will be much easier than hoping for something with him or one day losing this person forever. smoked a whole pack of cigarettes.It's very bad and I don't want to live",

It so happened that over time I stopped communicating with my peers, they all became more cunning than me, they could easily deceive and laugh. When I was studying I didn’t have enough money, I saved, when I began to work the same, now the mortgage - again I deny myself. After working for 7 years, it became clear that I would no longer make a career, they began to mock at home, sometimes for their own satisfaction. I have already quarreled with almost everyone, sometimes on purpose, as if by chance, they will say offensive in the trail, they know what you will worry about. 3 years ago my bladder was removed - now I am an ass-ts, a person - an empty space, I am ashamed, very ashamed of myself. I have never had any luck with girls, and now it’s better not to beat me, as if it’s impossible to start a family. Feeling of useless life, lack of strength, desire began to appear often. Better to tell powerlessness what to do. And sometimes about suicide. And just to exist and reluctantly, I feel like an old man with a broken brain.",

1,"How sometimes one person and one mistake can change and distort the whole future life. I'll tell you briefly, I met a man for two years. He is my first love and my first relationship. He appeared when I had problems in my life. We met for two years. and during these two years he did not allow himself anything superfluous. We met in 2012, two years of joy and happiness. I was so happy with him. But it turns out how long a person can disguise himself. All these two years he simply deceived me, but for these two years I managed to conduct a relationship in parallel with another girl. We met the new 2014 together, went to his friends. That evening he turned for me into a fairy tale that turned into a nightmare. I drank a lot, drank a lot in my first lives. I don’t remember anything. I just passed out. But I trusted him like no one else. I thought that everything would be fine. But he simply took advantage of my helpless state and you guessed that. But as if nothing had happened, he declared that he loved another and everything was over. Choice forces me as an unnecessary thing. 4 years have passed, he lives happily, his daughter is growing up. He created a happy family. And after that incident I broke down very much. I lost the taste of life. divorce after that incident, I met a worthy person but could not live with him because that trauma made itself felt. I was afraid that he would betray me too and leave me as a result she provoked him to divorce. I sit alone. I am sitting in four walls. I cannot get settled. In general, I live and do not live, that one case broke my life. I turned into a psychopath who does not trust anyone. And I also have a papillomavirus infection, in the future I can die of cancer. I was treated but they again appeared candidomas and now there is no money for treatment. But you know, I'm not afraid of dying. Why is it better to die like this. I have no future, no present. And the one who destroyed my life lives happily. And he is not tormented by the conscience that he ruined the whole life of a naive fool who is I was in love with him and believed him so much. All these two years I endured and waited for the moment. That night the moment came. And then this disease crawled out. And I wanted to live happily. I am tormented and guilt before my ex-husband, I could not make him happy .Sama ruined my life. Why did I trust this hypocrite so much, but during those two years I did not feel a trick. Apparently he was well disguised. The only consolation is that I give advice here to people who are in trouble at least from me at least some benefit. so that everyone would be happy. Thank you who will give advice and support me. Pray for me, I ask you!",

1," dear visitors of this site. I never thought that I would ever write here, but I need your help. I don't even know what to do next. I am tormented by a feeling of hopelessness. I think I slipped to the very bottom. Let's start. I am 14 years old and I am going to the 9th grade (I went to school at the age of 6). As you all know, in the 9th grade, at the end of the academic year, there will be transfer exams, after passing which you will move to the 10th grade. But I understand perfectly well that I will not pass them, since I am stupid, I have an undeveloped intellect and I am unable to memorize material. Instead of the GIA, we will have the Unified State Exam (a new program and it is much more complicated). Even if I remember the material, after a while it disappears from me. I thought I was studying this summer, but again I did not succeed, I naively believed that ""I will still have time for everything."" I’m not doing well with mathematics, I never understood it, I’ve also had problems with English (we’ll have an exam in it too), I’m not friends with other subjects (we’ll have exams in some of them too) ... We are not Russian we rent, since I do not live in Russia, and in general I am not Russian. It's already the middle of summer, and I haven't even started reading literature for the summer (there are 15 books on the list). I can't get serious, smart, start learning. I just hate myself. My classmates scoff at me, call me stupid, ugly, start thinking that something is wrong with my hygiene. I do not know how to carry on a conversation, I am uninteresting and boring. I have complexes because of my height (about 173 cm). I'm just down. In life, I do not succeed, I have no hobbies, no friends. I'm terribly lazy and insecure. I also blame myself for not being able to help my pen pal (corresponded on VKontakte) to cope with thoughts of suicide. I rarely wrote to her, but I supported her, said that everything would work out for her. But then she deleted her page and I don't even know what happened to her. Now I am tormented by this. I wrote here because I think there are people here who can help me. Thank you for attention.",
1,", I don't want to live anymore, I'm thinking now what to do with myself. It scares and pains me to realize that I have no one. Recently my beloved father died. And I stayed with my mother, since I do not have my own home, I depend on her. After the death of her father, she was going to leave our big city, where she needed to visit her beloved relatives, but I had to go with her since I had no housing. When we arrived, I was shocked, the city is terrible, like a village that can be walked around in an hour, and it cannot be called a city. My life has become hell. My mother hates me now. I do not communicate with any of Her relatives. She bought a one-room apartment on the very edge of this hole. Although it was possible with that money to buy something more attractive. In general, every day begins with swearing and swearing. She kicks me out and tells me to leave her. She says that I'm sitting on her neck. I don’t ask her for a penny of money. Sometimes I give her from myself. In this city I have no one, no friends, relatives, there are several acquaintances with whom I see occasionally. I can’t take it anymore so I can’t get a job because it’s just not there. It's hard for me here, I don't want to live anymore ... what should I do, is there a way out ... Because of all this, I became withdrawn, became secretive, nervous, I don't want to leave the house, I can't tell her about my problems, I feel mental problems cannot be avoided. When every day my mother kicks me out on the mats. She says that I should die, although she is 50 years old.

She makes me clean the house, and if I do something wrong, she hits me and yells. No exaggeration. I have no friends. Only friends and classmates. I cannot start a conversation normally and therefore no one is friends with me. In the summer, I sit in the room all day and do not go out. Nobody notices me anyway. I'm also very fat and ugly.

What is the problem then? Probably in me. My parents are very powerful people. They never hit me, of course. Physically. But they spoiled my psyche notably. As far back as I can remember, there have always been quarrels. Once every six months, for several months, throwing a wedding ring somewhere on the shelf and threatening to divorce. During one of these quarrels, I thought about suicide. I could not make a step, which I regret. Why? I'm also interested to know this. They raised me the way powerful people raise their children. I am a stupid, useless rag. In the most terrible moments of my life - when my parents scold me - they say that all my problems are from idleness. Like, I would be doing something useful, and not sitting at the computer and not drawing, then everything would be fine. Outsiders say that I am special, gifted. My mother said the same. Once upon a time. Now she, with tears in her eyes, shouts to me: ""Be you a normal teenager!"" Dad, on the other hand, grumbles that everyone's adolescence is long over, but I will be forever. I am unsociable, even, perhaps, a misanthrope and social phobia. It is physically difficult for me to be in noisy companies. The head constantly hurts. Parents raise me as a child and are furious that I am dependent. They told me that I was not like everyone else, but now with screams they demand to be ""normal"". They forbade me to run and jump like other children, and now they look with disgust as I go up to the fourth floor with shortness of breath and almost faint when I look up. The result of this education is extremely pitiful. A helpless, useless creature, with flabby muscles, a bunch of cockroaches on the head, unable to even pronounce his name without stuttering, afraid of people, having no opinion even when choosing clothes, with infinitely low self-esteem. If there are future parents among those reading this, I pray you: do not bring up your children in this way, never. I am my own prison. I dream of dying, but I can't do it. While. The only person who understands me is still alive - my grandfather. He is now 78 years old. Therefore, I have 10-20 years left to live, no more. And then? Will I be able to die? Or will I stay to disappoint everyone and myself in the first place? After all, I am not capable of more. Today my mother told me that she ""endured"" me for a long time. Then she listed all my jambs. Yes, she has a wonderful memory. I love my parents and I hate myself.",

1,"Здравствуйте, меня зовут Настя, мне 15 лет.Долго не решалась написать на этот сайт, поскольку не хочу показаться многим ленивой, избалованной девочкой, которая хочет вызвать жалость. Но сегодня я поняла, что уже не могу так жить, хочу умереть. История банальная и долгая, буду благодарна если прочитаете, и даже поможете. Уверена что большинство ответов будет по типу:""В твоем возрасте убиваться из-за первой любви глупо!"". В 2016 году перешла в новую школу, в прошлой школе меня оскорбляли и не было друзей.Я сама по себе очень закрытый и замкнутый человек, боюсь новых знакомств и коллективов. Уже тогда я начинала задумываться о смысле жизни, поняла что жизнь-очень скучная и бессмысленная, по крайней мере моя.В ноябре влюбилась в одноклассника, я ему тоже понравилась. Начали встречаться,это были мои первые отношения, и развивались они достаточно быстро, чуть до постели не дошло(По его инициативе). В отношениях с ним я совершенно забыла о родителях, я думала что у меня наконец-то появился тот человек, который всегда поддержит и поймет. С родителями отношения были мягко говоря не очень. Мы живем в квартире отчима, и в новогоднюю ночь очень сильно с ним поссорилась. После чего мама сказала, что мы переезжаем к бабушке, для меня это был нереальный стресс, но я не восприняла это всерьез, мама просто меня запугивала.С родителями все более-менее налаживалось, а с парнем наоборот, нам абсолютно не о чем было поговорить, я стала его ревновать, а он хотел этого, специально при мне обнимался со своими подругами,начал сильно манипулировать, говорить как ему плохо и грустно, мне от этого было еще хуже. И однажды от его друга я узнала о том, что Д(Допустим, мой парень), встречается со мной чтобы полапать, я решила его бросить, хотя очень не хотела этого .Я его бросила, после чего я намеренно притворилась больной чтобы не идти в школу, ибо я не могла его видеть, слезы сами наворачивались на глаза, потом я начала ему писать, извиняться, просить о встречи, хотела все вернуть. У меня на тот момент БЫЛ друг, он написал этому Д, и спросил хочет ли тот со мной встречаться, оказалось у него уже была новая ""Любовь"", узнав об этом, у меня был нервный срыв, первый срыв в моей жизни.Потом я начала общаться его друзями Н и Л( Один из них как раз и рассказал почему Д со мной встречается) Начали вместе гулять, иногда Д гулял с нами, после чего парни мне рассказывали то, что мой бывший говорит обо мне за спиной, он говорил что я жирная, плоская и вообще стремная, у меня и без него самооценка ниже некуда.Потом эти парни меня кинули и стали обсуждать между собой, я осталась одна. Снова скандал с родителями, лезвие, вены, антидепрессанты. Таблетки помогли на месяц. Угадайте что опять?Правильно, ссора с предками. Все дошло до того, что я ушла из дома, конечно же меня нашли. Мама сказала, что я переезжаю к бабушке,я снова восприняла это как банальную угрозу, но это оказалось не так. В один день мама пришла с большой сумкой и сказала собирать вещи. Я судорожно собрала. Меня силой потащили в машину, и отобрали мою собаку, сказали что продадут, у меня была истерика. Приехала к бабушке, думала она меня поддержит и поймет, она начала читать лекции и сказала, что дальше будет только хуже. Я начала впадать в панику, с того дня у меня каждый день панические атаки. Через несколько дней все стало нормально. Я поехала домой. Но сейчас при малейшей оплошности мама угрожает тем, что снова отправит меня к бабушке и отберет собаку и интернет(А я от него зависима). С момента расставания у меня слабость, абсолютно ни на что нет сил, скинула около 7 кг, что меня порадовало, ведь у меня был комплекс из-за лишнего веса.Вот-вот я начала забывать парня, и бац, в начале июня начал мне писать. По-началу банально комментировал фотки, а потом начал писать, общались ни о чем.И мои чувства снова дали о себе знать. Не знаю что на меня нашло, но мне показалось, что он хочет возобновить отношения, и я ему написала такое сообщение:""В общем,у меня остались к тебе чувства, и я хочу чтобы ты это знал"" На что он ничего не ответил.Вечером этого же дня он начал мне кидать наши совместные фото, мне стало оочень грустно, я спросила зачем он это делает, он сказал, что ему просто скучно. Потом он начал кидать мне песенки разные, он так делал когда мы встречались, а потом он спросил:""Любишь меня?"". Сердце реально чуть не выскочило из груди, я перевела вопрос на его сторону, он сказал, что чувства остались. Я предложила восстановить отношения, он долго думал, но согласился, я сразу поняла, что он словно делает мне одолжение, сказал:""Ну ладно"". Я предложила на следующий день сходить погулять.Погуляли, мне очень понравилось, я снова начала в жизни видеть смысл, мы ходили за ручку,обнимались и все такое) Но когда я пришла домой , он мне не писал. И на следующий день тоже не писал.Я сама написала, он ответил холодно и неохотно. Предложила встретиться перед тем как я поеду к родственникам в Новгород, он согласился. Это должно было произойти сегодня(28 июня), но прямо перед встречей он сказал, что не сможет прийти. До меня дошло что я тупо ему не нужна. Сейчас снова плачу и не могу успокоиться. Боюсь, что если я за лето и смогу его забыть, то в сентябре чувства снова проявятся. Что мне делать? Я так устала, меня все достало. Мама заставляет ходить на танцы, я не хочу, обманываю ее.Просто так с ней не поговоришь, скажет, что отправит к бабушке и будет говорить какая я плохая и ленивая. Я хочу умереть, задолбало все. Помогите((((((",

I have friends, but they often do not care for me, they already have their own families. And I only had two unhappy loves, and that's all. And now I love it again.

I stopped being afraid of death, only so as not to be a burden to my parents in case of illness. When I think that suddenly I will live for 80 years I get scared that for so long I will live my terrible life.

What should I do so that they are not afraid and feel good, I struggle with myself every day, I go to work, I try to live a full life, but it costs my nerves a lot.

I was expecting a baby (I have 2 more sons, but I always wanted a lot of children), the pregnancy was going fine, but the baby died at 17 weeks. At first I could not believe it, although our doctor is very knowledgeable and she herself was terribly upset when this happened, examined for a long time, then sent me to the regional center, there they examined several times, in general, the baby was really dead and, apparently, not the first day. I was given birth. A kind of cheerful abortionist came and said: ""Well, you have already given birth, you will throw it out quickly!"" (Yeah, straight the bucket into the garbage chute). Well, I understand, of course, their medical cynicism, but even if everyone called it in scientific terms ... He was small, already shriveled up (they explained to me that the kids in these cases are reduced in size), he looks like a kitten. I was told that if it hurts, then pain relief can be done.

1,"Простите, что я ною, но мне очень страшно. На прошлой неделе мне исполнилось 22 года и меня как-будто холодной водой облило от осознания этого... Вроде уже солидный возраст, но в жизни не было ничего такого, что бы говорило мне об этом возрасте. Общество давит, постоянно спрашивают когда замуж, почему я не замужем, на днях соседка даже сказала""Что, состарилась на 1 год вчера?"" меня это просто убило. Раньше я всегда считала, что выйду замуж где-то после 25, что то, что до - это вообще еще зеленость и нужно гулять, но сейчас смотрю на своих сверстников и осознаю, что как внешне, так и внутренне я младше, инфантильнее их и я не хочу взрослеть! У некоторых уже семьи, даже дети, у 99% были отношения и первый сексуальный опыт. Честно говоря, меня спрашивают ""тебе 16?"", по крайней мере, пару таких вопросов звучало недавно, когда узнают возраст, удивляются. К тому же, я девственница до сих пор... С одной стороны это может показаться хорошим, но меня это нереально пугает. Так получилось, что мамиными усилиями я закончила университет в этом году и можно сказать, не училась, не набиралась опыта общения... У меня была какая-то жизнь на 1-2 курсе, но потом со мной случилась одна история: я была сильно влюблена в парня, с которым у нас не сложилось, из-за меня. Такое ощущение, то после этого разрыва и страданий, самокопания я стала взрослее, циничнее, депрессивнее, я сильно перестрадала, до сих пор с вспоминаю это время с содроганием. После этого запустила себя, стала прогуливать, просто ходила по улицам и слушала музыку, и много ела, наела себе кг почти под 90. Никогда не была худой, но это уже слишком. До него была такой наивной, у меня был свой круг, своя жизнь, свои т.н.""приключения"", ""истории"". В общем, у меня не было именно того, что любят девочки в подростковом периоде:краситься, наряжаться, ходить по дискотекам.Я всегда избегала этого, сидела дома, ездила с родителями на отдых, в поездки, либо изредка выбиралась со школьными подругами творить какие-то истории, о которых сейчас смешно вспоминать. Мне страшно... Наверное, это то, что должна пройти каждая, а у меня этого не было и сейчас я не знаю как это сделать. Также пугает, что парни ищут девушек младше себя на много лет и мне уже не светит парень моего возраста, а только мужчина за 30, и то, если повезет... Также страшно, что после того разрыва у меня не получается смотреть на мир также наивно, как-будто что-то сломалось и сделало из меня склочную депрессивную бабенку... Мужчин притягивает в девушках молодость, непосредственность и наивность, а я уже не такая, не та, что раньше. Я очень боюсь общения, даже с девушками(не то, что с парнями) своего возраста, убегаю, ссылаюсь на дела.. Такое ощущение, что я знаю наперед, что это ничем не закончится, мне как-будто не интересно общаться... Какой-то камень на душе... Просто не о чем говорить. Во всем вижу негатив, такое ощущение, что люди получают кайф от зла, которое творится в мире, смакуют это, по новостям один негатив. Иногда у меня случается общение с моими родственниками, но они все старшего возраста на пару десятков лет. Мне просто неуютно со сверстниками и я не знаю, что мне делать.... У меня после этого разрыва были и психологи, и психиатры, ничего не помогло..Я ходила по полгода к психологу, который брал с меня огромные деньги за сеанс, но это мне не помогло, я только больше ушла в себя. Родители сказали, что психологов больше не будет и я сама должна решать, что мне делать и как мне жить дальше. Говорят, что я ленивая и не хочу ничего делать, от этого и все проблемы и ни один психолог мне этого не даст. Хотя я слышу, как мама плачет, когда закрывается в комнате, она просто не знает что со мной делать, она кричит, говорит, что у нее безысходность... Да и я не знаю... Лучше просто уйти, в никуда, закончить это, ведь былую наивность не вернешь, и близким от меня одни страдания, а дальше только хуже...",

The wedding should have been done in 4 In 4 months, everything changed. We decided to postpone the wedding, he invested money in a new building at the construction stage. Delivery in 2 years. 1.5 g passed from the date of purchase, he took out the mortgage on himself. All this time we did not live together, he is with his parents, I am with my parents. an apartment with decoration, he offers me to live in a civil marriage for another year while we buy furniture while we collect money for the wedding. Although his parents have money and could help a little with money mi. Anyway .

I’m asking him a question, I’m already 31, I need an official status and plan a child. And by the way, I have problems with gynecology, the doctor told me I need to now. To which they replied, I am not yet ready, I have no time for this, but forget about the children of about 2 years at all. And in general I changed my mind in vain. I now have a mortgage, I don’t want to take responsibility for my family and children, I don’t need extra spending. And in general, what do you think you are the only one so beautiful you want a family of children, half of the country wants and how many are the same beautiful girls. Like, you're not so different. I did everything for our relationship, soul, heart. I helped him from the bottom of my heart. , and you are obsessed with the wedding and children, I don’t need all this yet, my life is just beginning and you are left at a broken trough at 31 .... it hurts, he destroyed me.

1,". I can’t live like this anymore. I’m sick of everything. I suffer in this World. There are many reasons to leave this world, because of the problems I cannot solve. The first is hatred of my mother, I am mortally annoyed by her voice, without speaking about her actions. She did not deal with me as a child and, accordingly, did not grow up to developed with complexes. The second is a mental wound, a year ago she left the girl whom she loved madly and I love, she was very cruel. The third is the material part, I have nothing, but I can't earn money because of self-doubt due to low self-esteem, the fourth is loneliness, it turns me inside out and does not allow me to live normally. And finally, the most terrible thing is internal torment, I constantly suffer, constant depression as long as I can remember, psychotherapists incline this as inborn traits, antidepressants do not help as well as tranquilizers. NOBODY understands how hard it is for me, but only humiliate and poke me. I myself sit idle, I don’t know what to do how to solve my problems, plus another problem I’m with documents that older family members cannot. The most that I’m afraid is to be left alone, that no one else will fall in love, I’m just as afraid to remain nobody as I am now. Sorry for nagging, it’s a shame.",

No, I am not weak, I achieved everything in my life myself, because. Mom died early, and my father never needed my family or I personally, he drank a lot, beat my mother and me. I don't see the meaning of my life. Work has already incinerated, and before retirement, at best, 3 years.

But, in the end, when my studies began, I realized that this was not mine and nothing worked for me, but I tried and studied as best I could, but in the end, on the 2nd year, such a result ...

Mom was disgraced by Dad, rumors will run around the city, you creature! ... this is just a small part of what I hear every day now. After each word I can't hold back tears, everything in my chest contracts. There is not a single person on my side: I have almost no friends, only 2 best friends, but they do not know about my situation, because I am ashamed to tell them about my expulsion, because they continue to study, what if they stop communicating with someone like me. I want to sink into the ground so that no one can see or hear me, I have no strength to see glances full of hatred in people I love. Even suicidal thoughts appear.

Probably, I chose the wrong specialty, or maybe I just turned out to be not ready for an independent life. I don't know why, after about 2 months of study, I plunged into depression. Since then, I constantly cry, sobbing, sometimes I can't even explain the reason. I became the darkest person on earth. All the time I walk alone, it became a burden to me to communicate with people. I hated myself and my life. I wanted to die. The saddest thing is that I cannot explain what exactly is wrong. I started having panic attacks. It happens like this: tears, hysteria, it is impossible to breathe, and it seems to me that everyone conspired against me, all people, things, events. It's like my life is a big conspiracy theory. I stopped going to school. Several times I didn't go because it seemed to me that my classmates decided to get rid of me. At school, it became boring and scary, I can not teach anything. In times of panic, she began to cut herself, left a large scar. She began to drink a lot, got into debt. She began to steal on trifles, caught, paid a fine. There are debts for my studies, I am on the verge of deduction. I hardly leave the house. I started having sex with a guy, which doesn't humiliate me, just like that. She studied well at school, was decent and did nothing of the kind. Now she is disgusting to herself. It seems to me that I have fallen so low that now the only way out is to die.",

1,"Здравствуйте, мне 14 лет и у меня есть проблема - я ни на что не годен. Нет, я не инвалид, спасибо хоть за это, мне не ставили диагнозы умственно-отсталого, такого нет. Но сколько я не пытаюсь - я везде только вред приношу. Я часто туплю и не понимаю, что от меня надо, когда я помогаю кому-то, то из-за моей криворукости всегда что-нибудь роняю, ломаю, порчу. Нет, не специально, просто руки ""не из того места"". Всё, что я начинаю делать, мастерить выходит кривое, непрочное, ненадёжное. У других же всё нормально. Я не знаю, где мне определиться. Я ни с чем нормально не справляюсь. Я ещё более-менее нормально могу установить ОС на компьютер, и то только windows и только при идеальных условиях, когда нету никаких ошибок установки и прочего. Я уже полтора года увлекаюсь и изучаю компьютеры. За это время я научился собирать, разбирать, чистить ПК, в систему много чего делать. Но вот сегодня меня на одном форуме назвали ламером, то есть человеком, который слабо разбирается в компьютерах и сам не знает что он делает, ну вы поняли, что-то типа нуба в играх. Поначалу я подумал, ну и пофиг, у меня руки из жопы и я тупой. Но потом я вспомнил, что пытаюсь повысить свою самооценку, так что унижать себя хватит. Я подумал, почему меня так назвали, что во мне не так. И тут всплыло: я же столько всего знаю про эти чёртовы компьютеры, а сам ничего не умею. Ну не способен, руки кривые, тут скрывать нечего. Даже при таких знаниях. То вентилятор сломал, то порт расшатал, то диск угробил, то система не запускается. А зачем мне тогда такие знания, если я ничего не могу руками, только в теории всё? Я ни на что не годен. Только в теории. Я считаю, что уже в мои 14 надо задумываться о своей взрослой жизни, чем я буду заниматься. И мне ещё очень повезло, что мне полтора года назад подарили windows-планшет, ведь до этого у меня не было вообще никаких ПОЛЕЗНЫХ интересов, на которых можно было бы строить взрослую жизнь. Всё, что я любил прежде - играть в ""Лего"". Потому что ничего другого, кроме ""Лего"" у меня не было, да и не было денег у родителей, как нету и сейчас. Да и мне тогда больше и не нужно было. А сейчас? Ну да, связал я свою жизнь с чем-то полезным и интересным. Но опять же, знаю я много, а делать это ну не получается. Из-за этого постоянные насмешки и унижения от других. Особенно обидно, когда в интернете, т.к. в нём нельзя драться, что у меня хорошо получается. А я мстительный и неуравновешенный, и когда меня начинают унижать, то даже поорать, как я делаю с одноклассниками в таких случаях, не получается. Накапливается злость. А потом выходит, что я меня кто-то выбесил унижениями и ничем хорошим это не заканчивается. Зачем мне так жить? Даже с людьми нормально не могу общаться! Просто не о чем, не такой я как все! Я давно вышел из общего стада, потому что меня вообще не устраивает жизнь моих бывших друзей: целыми днями шататься по городу, орать матами на всю улицу и унижать всех. Но все такие, я не такой, меня такое не устраивает. И если у меня что-то и получается, то такое никому не нужно и вообще не будет работы про это(или будет, но за очень малую плату). Я надеюсь, вы меня поняли. И да, ещё одна проблема: я изгой везде. Меня часто унижают или попросту игнорируют, на мои зовы о помощи либо не откликаются, либо откликаются очень редко, либо опять-таки с унижениями. Даже в интернете, незнакомые мне люди. Только на YouTube'е такого нету(ну во всяком случае, там меня гораздо меньше и реже унижают). У меня есть 2 хороших друга, они пытаются мне помочь, но так как они моего возраста и не сталкивались с моими проблемами, то выходит, что помочь некому. Родители? Они знают, что у меня проблемы с общением в школе. Кроме драки ничего не помогает. Но говорить им, ""что некий чувак из интернета назвал меня плохим словом"" как-то глупо и слишком по-детски. Тем более им не понравится, что я буду их постоянно дёргать из-за того, что кто-то меня назвал дураком. Или просто отберут у меня wi-fi адаптер. Я везде не вписываюсь, везде я лишний. Нету группы, кружка, где я чувствую себя нужным ну или хотя бы человеком, а не бездушно шагающем в стороне манекеном.  Я не чувствую себя уютно в этой жизни. У меня вечно проблемы, я вечно влипаю в какие-нибудь переделки, вечно всё плохое происходит именно со мной. Я не хочу умирать. В данной ситуации, если конечно же и дальше будет так продолжаться, я бы предпочёл быть бродягой, сомнительной личностью. Нигде не работать, бродить и красть еду, чтобы были силы бесцельно шататься по миру. Я не вижу иного выхода, но умирать не хочу.",
1,"I ruined my life myself. My life is terrible. I have nothing, I am nobody, my every day is filled with suffering and regrets about the past. Since childhood, I have been shy, but I never thought that my shyness would develop into an irrational fear that would ruin my whole life. As a teenager, I went through a psychological trauma that ruined my entire future life. I didn't notice my strangeness until I entered college. My every day was filled with fear, I was afraid to go out, speak at seminars, because every time I was terribly shaken and shaken. But I continued to study because I believed in the best. While still in school, I fell in love with a person whom I had never met, but I was sure that I would certainly meet. At school, suffering from unrequited love, I turned to God and told Him that I could not suffer and that the next time He sends me love, let it be turned to my future husband. I saw a man on TV, I really liked him, I fell in love with him and the confidence began to live in me that I would certainly meet him. And I met him, but I was terribly shy of him. We met with his ""eyes"" for several years. Rather, he tried to get to know me, and I ran away from him over the years, terribly embarrassed and asking God not to give him to anyone. I was very tormented during this time, the day came when I told myself now or never and decided to get acquainted at all costs, and when he found out who I am, he humiliated and disgraced me. If I stood up for myself, he would not dare to do this ... I am to blame for everything myself. He broke my life, and I could not stand up for myself. I ended up in a mental hospital, spent a long amount of time there. During this time, my languages ​​were forgotten, I studied at the Faculty of Foreign Languages, I dropped out. He later tried to reconnect with me, told me that he liked me more than the girl he started dating, but my fear and pride did not allow me to open the door for him. Now I have been sitting at home for more than 4 months, because I am afraid to go outside alone. I only go outside with my parents. This young man is getting ready to marry another, beautiful and confident. And I have no profession, no future, fear tied me hand and foot. Every day I think about this young man and how many times fate has given me a chance, but missed it because of my fear. Lately it seems that I hear voices that offend me. Maybe God punished me for the fact that I could not change myself and missed my fate. I could move abroad, but fear does not let me even here, because I do not dare to leave my own apartment. I could have had a wonderful life if I was different, but I have not changed. Such fools as I have never seen. I have no strength to change ... Now I am nobody, nobody needs me. I see no way out but suicide.",
1,"Здравствуйте. Мне 17 лет, а я не хочу жить, особенно в последнее время. Расскажу всё в подробностях, только прошу вас не подумайте что я больна и т.д. С детства я живу в вымышленном мире и дружу с мультяшками, так уж получилось родится мне с таким воображением которое и довело меня до таких мыслей. Кроме этого я с 5 лет трушу что то в руках и не могу без этого. Даже телевизор смотрю стоя и трушу ремни которые у меня в руках,при этом сильно згебая спину что в мои 17 у меня спина искревлена просто ужасно. Я просто не могу жить без трушения чего то в руках, я много раз пыталась бросить, но все попытки кончались безуспешно. У меня вообще нет друзей в реальной жизни, в школе меня все дразнили и в деревне которой я живу все считают меня за умственно отсталую, хотя это не так. Я целыми днями сижу в вк, потому что там меня никто не видит и у меня там есть друзья. Но я до того досочинялась что влюбилась в одного мультяшного героя и очень хочу быть с ним, но это реально лишь в моём воображении и то мне постоянно кажется что возле меня кто то стоит и наблюдает за мной. Это не галлюцинация, просто я представляю возле себя мультяшек что мне уже кажется что они рядом всегда. Я не могу разговаривать с людьми изо вечного чувства наблюдения, даже чтоб выйти в магазин мне надо напрячся, перебороть свой страх и идти. 1 сентября этого года меня хотят отправить в Суровикино учится на повара, но для этого мне придётся растатся со своими вымышленными друзьями которых я так люблю, потому что если я останусь с ними то я не смогу нормально жить. Но я очень их люблю и не хочу расставаться и поэтому я очень боюсь ехать в Суровикино. Мой папа умер 24 августа прошлого года и мама нашла себе нового и он теперь живёт с нами. К тому же у мамы проблемы с потреблением алкоголя. Начала она пить когда мне было 12 и м этого возраста я столько претерпела пьянок в моём доме и папа тоже выпивал. Но пьёт она не каждый день, она работает держит на себе хозяйство, но если сорвется то пеши пропало. Я вообще не хочу жить потому что не вижу жизни без своих мультяшных друзей которых мне прийдется бросить и с проблемами мамы и в свои 17 я не к чему не приспособлена, даже заплетатся не умею. И мои мысли мне постоянно наговаривают всякую ерунда, что например если я не дотронусь до столба то все будет плохо ч иду дотрагиватся и потом он наговаривает на другую вещь, что я бегают по всему подряд и дотрагиваюсь как дура что на до мной люди смеются. Как то раз мама купила халат и мои мысли на говорили что этот халат плохой и его надо выкинуть и я его выкинула. Мне это не нравится и я пытаюсь боротся, в последнее время я ничего не выеидывпю и даже тот халат вернула говоря себе что это все неправда ито всего лишь моё больное воображение. Мне ехать в Суровикино уже через два месяца, но я не готова. У меня в последнее время ходят мысли о суициде. Мне надоело так жить. Ч отеистка и не верю в бога и поэтому я не боюсь что породу в ад. Я уже продумываю способы как уйти без боли. Прошу вас помогите пока я ещё жива. Я не знаю что мне делать в моей ситуации, а ложится в психушку, я не псих, у меня просто развито воображение и я сроду не слышала голоса и меня не одолевали галлюцинации. Я в школе до 5 класса училась на отлично. Прошу вас помогите пожалуйста.",
1,"I am 27 years old, two higher educations, a good job, a workaholic by nature, I met real love. I suffer from an incomprehensible disorder. Everyone around me suffers, and I myself. I don't want to harm anyone, but somehow it starts by itself, word for word, and swearing begins. Although I always adhere to the position that I defend, not attack. The childhood was difficult, the alcoholism of the father, the moral pressure of the mother, the hatred of the brother due to the fact that his father was not his own and in a drunken stupor he took off his anger and beat them, and since I was loved by my father, they both tried through me, through insults and beatings to compensate for the pain that their father inflicted on them. As a result, he completely left the family, and the mother of three of us alone lifted as best she could. Then came various fortune tellers, psychics, shamans, through them my mother tried to find the strength not to give up and go forward, so that they gave faith that everything was fine. I understand her perfectly, in her place I would have broken down long ago. Now my father has returned to the family, he still drinks, but if earlier he was an authority for me, then after all this nightmare I learned to just perceive and respect him as a father. Mom went into religion, the brothers also matured, live their own lives. But people find it difficult with me. She seems smart, quick-witted, brave, but with me it is impossible to enjoy life. I can't ride like a naive little girl, I can't look at this world - how nice and fluffy it is. I try to trust people and do good things for them, it's not difficult at all. But I see no reason to live. Everything is somehow cyclical, if this is a rise, then at least I don't bother anyone, but I don't see the point. And if there is a recession, then this is a rolling terrible depression with thoughts of suicide. In the time interval, the decline period is a maximum of 5 days, then the decline period begins, and also lasts. Recently, I began to notice that the recession period has become more comfortable for me, in it I cry and emotions come out, a certain feeling of feeling of the inner self appears. During the ascent, I do not feel myself and as if I do everything from under a stick. I turned to psychologists and psychotherapists. All as one say that this is an external influence of stimuli. That I sacrifice my energies too openly, and I do not have enough for myself. That I should love myself. But in principle I love myself, at least I respect myself. Psychologists have never seen my emotional outlets, I live them on my own, without anyone's participation, because I understand that not everyone can be near at such moments. No friends, there was a best friend, but he died. I don’t know what to do next, you can continue to be in this cycle, but I don’t want to, but I’m tired of quarreling with my family too, and just the thought that I’m doing them harm, that they start to get nervous, that sugar may rise, that because of nerves, oncology may arise in them, I immediately begin to morally destroy myself for possible harm. At this time, the thought of death has become commonplace, I don't go out anywhere, I don't want to communicate with anyone, I don't go to work. I don't see the point in anything, fatigue.",
1,"I didn’t appreciate my husband, he left. Lives separately for 3 years. I now live with my son. I have a ps. Disease. In a manic state, meeting another, my head turned off completely, I went to him. There was a lot of alcohol, I didn't know what I was doing. At some point I returned home. But there was alcohol and I was carried ... partying, etc. The husband got angry, began to take revenge with his behavior. I was hospitalized for 3 months. Then, very late, I realized what I had done ... after I left the hospital, he left. After a while, I began to ask for forgiveness. He said he had forgiven. Now we communicate, but it is normal, then aggression comes from him, I can feel it by intonation. I'm afraid to be alone. I want the relationship to be like it once was, before the onset of my illness. But nothing adds up. He does not really like to discuss the problem, he, in principle, is an uncommunicative person. In connection with the disease, my memory, thinking, almost never-ending depression suffered. I understand that I cannot cope alone. He helps financially. But that's not it. I understand that I have lost the most valuable thing, my family. He seems to have got used to living alone. He had women, but something didn't work out there. I don’t know the details. I am dying of loneliness and fear of life's difficulties. I'm like a cowardly hare. I'm so tired of this state. Girlfriends ... all families have their own problems. I do not know what to do. I don't want to go to the hospital anymore, I don't want to leave my son. And so she already committed a disgusting deed when she left the family. The feeling of guilt covers me headlong. I despise myself for everything I have done. Choking on emptiness and loneliness. Not everything is smooth with my son, there is no normal communication. I don't have the strength to live like this. I see no way out. I don't want to go back to the hospital, I was there 4 times, it breaks me completely. I drink antidepressants, but they are of no use. I understand that it is my own fault. But what a way out, I hardly eat, the desire to eat has disappeared, the desire to go somewhere has disappeared. I am a vile, vile traitor. I am ashamed of myself. What to do, there is no strength to live like that.",
1,"Good evening. I'm 18 years old. I am very tired mentally, I want to speak out. I don't really have anyone to talk to .. The fact is that I'm very lonely. I have a family, but I feel like a stranger in it, I have no friends, there was a guy, but he left me. I have a beautiful appearance, everyone gives compliments, and what depresses me most is that everyone perceives me as a toy , a doll that you can play with and throw away when you get tired of it (((For the same reason, my boyfriend left me for the same reason, I still can't forget him, although quite a lot of time has passed ... in general, sorry for the confusion , I just feel very bad, morally I have been dead for a long time, I’m nobody and call me, I’m superfluous everywhere and always ... I just want to dissolve in the air. I thought about suicide",
1,"8th grade life went downhill. My classmates mocked me and said all sorts of nasty things that later affected my attitude towards myself. I began to study for deuces and became isolated. I always sat alone at the last desk and inspired myself that it was better to be alone. As a result, I moved to another school in the hope that life would change, but it was not there. My former classmates managed to tell this whole school all the nasty things they said about me, and in the new school they began to spread rot again. Then my nerves could not stand it. I tried to commit suicide. My relatives thought that I would remain a vegetable or not survive at all, but they managed to save me, but the consequences of the suicide severely undermined my psyche. I lost my memory, I cannot formulate my thoughts normally. It's just hell. I often began to feel sad, and then there was not mutual love .. I began to cut myself (but I regret it, now they come up to me and say, “Why are you cutting yourself?” Although 3 years have passed). I left after the 9th grade again in the same hope that everything would be different in college, but now my psyche does not allow me to do everything differently. I am already finishing the third course, and still (5 years) I cannot get out of this bottom. Lately I feel bad all the time, and why I can't understand. That's just bad. I want to fold, but as such there is no reason, although no, there is. “I don’t know anything” ... I don’t know what I want and I don’t know what to do, I don’t know anyone to lend a helping hand and tell me what to do next. I'm confused about everything. I have no incentive, no purpose, no boyfriend because no one needs me and no one likes me. I always explode like a bomb for every slightest reason. It’s awful and I’m not able to restrain myself. Constantly not happy with everything. Very nervous. I don't know what to do next with this ""life"" thing. Feeling as if I was given some kind of incomprehensible object with which I do not understand what to do and there is no one to tell. Friends are a problem. Outwardly, I cannot resist myself terribly. I don’t know how to be, what to do, what to expect. I teach me to be a rescuer and there is only hope that I will soon die saving someone's life.",
1,"At some point, my relationship crashed. Perhaps it began long ago, but then it seemed that everything would change. Now we already have a child, 1 year old, and I have no strength for anything. Sitting with a child is not difficult, it is difficult with a husband. He is in charge, he is always right, and if he is not right, then I am still to blame. He is constantly offended by something. And you have to guess what this time. For example, when the child was small, he slept very badly and woke up because of any rustle, my husband did not take into account this and did everything quite noisily, I dropped the phrase ""wake you up - I will kill you"", to which he simply left for three days and I then had to apologize for a long time. Recently, having done all the chores around the house, having put the child to bed, after midnight I went to the store, he did not even notice that I was gone for a long time, since the place where I wanted to go turned out to be closed. I brought two heavy bags of food. When she said that she could go with me, again a worldwide resentment. He litters more than a child, everything from his plate always falls to the floor, but picking up is not a tsar matter, but a remark - again offended. He doesn’t go to the shower. ""it smells good."" Moreover, he is often not at home, he has ""a lot of things to do."" And when he is at home, he begins to morally crush me. Recently I hit it in the face and again I had to apologize.

They are all successful, someone goes to a sports school, receives certificates, medals, someone copes with their studies perfectly.

1,"Good afternoon. I am almost 23 years old, I live in an apartment with my parents, I have no personal life, my friends are mostly scattered all over the world. And my problem is that my mom expects too much of me. She herself is a very intelligent woman, a professional in her specialty, but she does not see anything beyond her. She says that my duty is to get a higher education degree while she is still alive. I have already left faculties twice because of difficulties in interacting with the group, which greatly complicates the educational process. I, personally, am not a stupid person, but it is very difficult for me to study with the class, and after a year and a half, panic attacks and fear of going to the university appear. Now for almost a year I have been telling my mother that I am studying, but in reality I am not doing anything, because I just want to rest for a year. If after graduating from school I had this year, everything would be better, but my mother is constantly rushing, which makes me even more scared. Recently, I have not seen a solution other than suicide, but I perfectly understand that this is not an option. I read books on psychology, I try to figure out myself and how to live on, I am afraid and cannot admit to my mother that I have been doing absolutely nothing for a whole year. The plans include only vague horizons with a job search and admission to part-time education, but my mother will not approve of this and will say that I will grow up like my father - a loser alcoholic.

My mother is annoying, but I can't move out because there is no work. And I'm scared to work, because I don't want to communicate with people at all, because with them you can get into an awkward situation. And I'm also afraid that this will all be a waste of time and I will be dumped. There is no decent job in my city (even more so at 18). It's scary that they will laugh at me if I work as a saleswoman. And it will be unpleasant for me to work for her. The ""friends"" have plans for life, relationships, but I envy them.

At school there were only humiliations and beatings, classmates knew that my dad was an alcoholic and beat me, not allowing me to live in peace. That was until the end of the school. Until the end of my life, I will regret not doing the profession I have dreamed of all my life. The fact is that my mother and grandmother forced me to enter the pedagogical department by force, and I have always dreamed of becoming a doctor since childhood. At the age of 16, I tried to commit suicide, when I realized what mistake I made and that I did not insist on my decision, but 2 weeks in the hospital and I am still alive.

I begged my parents to transfer me to another school, but it was in vain. So I got complexes about my weight. At the age of 9, I was hit by a car when I crossed the road incorrectly. She escaped with bruises and concussion. I regret that I survived then. If not for the briefcase, then death. My father always yelled at me when I did something wrong. He blamed me for everything and said that it would be better if I hadn't been. So I acquired a sense of guilt and wanted to commit suicide even as a child. He still screams, used to raise his hand. I fell in love with a colleague and began to spoil everything that was good between us. I am sorry that I live. As a child, on the river, when I had no strength, I could not emerge and felt lightness ... I don't want to live ... I'm tired. I send life to the closest people. I have no friends.

1,"Добрый день, уважаемые форумчане! Хочу поделиться с вами своей историей, поскольку сил держать все в себе уже не нахожу. Мне 20 лет. С детства у меня болезнь: дцп в легкой форме, но жизни это не мешает, нет никаких дефектов речи и серьёзных нарушений движений, разве что походка чуть неустойчивая, но это практически незаметно. Со стороны я выгляжу полностью здоровым человеком. Учусь на 2 курсе в Москве. И за последние 2-3 года я перестала видеть хоть какой-то смысл в своём дальнейшем существовании. У меня совсем нет друзей, разве что одна лучшая подруга, с которой я дружу вот уже 13 лет, (со школьной скамьи) и которой я действительно доверяю и знакомая по университету, но её я держу ""на расстоянии"", поскольку не верю в искренность намерений, и иногда это проявляется. Моя лучшая подруга часто занята, мы видимся, но сейчас довольно редко (раз в месяц), потому что учимся в разных ВУЗах. Моя жизнь состоит из схемы: ""дом-учеба, дом учеба"" и так каждый день. Других друзей у меня нет, пробую общаться сама в университете, но чувствую, что люди не хотят общения со мной, они просто отдаляются. По выходным-начинается отдельная песня, сижу в четырёх стенах, независимо от времени года и погоды, полностью поглощённая своими мрачными мыслями. Пробовала ходить на развлекательные мероприятия и в торговые центры одна-становилось ещё хуже, поскольку вокруг много компании и влюблённых пар. Возвращаясь домой, често бросалась на диван и просто плакала от безысходности, что я совсем никому не нужна. Живу с родителями. Мама меня очень-очень любит, да и я её, но она видимо, так и не распрощалась с мыслью о том, что мне уже 20, а не 10. Может сильно меня опекать. Из-за этого порой срываюсь на неё, говорю обидные слова, о чем потом горько жалею. Отец живёт с нами, но они с мамой давно в разводе, а квартира одна, податься нам больше некуда. Он порядочный и спокойный человек, но меня он не замечает. Общение ограничивается ""привет""-""пока"", и если повезёт, парой бытовых фраз, и то, когда рядом нет мамы. Финансовую помощь он мне никогда по своей воле не оказывал, даже не спрашивал про мою жизнь, как у меня дела, что с поступлением (когда поступала в ВУЗ). На выпускной он тоже не дал денег, даже и не спросил про это, все было куплено на мои накопленные и конечно на мамины. Но он работает, половину з/п всегда отдаёт маме, видимо испытывая угрызения совести за то, что в прошлом не платил алименты. Мама тоже работает, в основном, обеспечивает меня они, ну и стипендия, которая очень маленькая. Я живу в их квартире, не могу съехать жить отдельно, поскольку ещё учусь, график плотный, работать времени нет. Да и не знаю куда идти без законченного высшего. А сидеть в 20 лет на маминой шее, как нахлебница, мне крайне стыдно. Ровесницы постоянно с кем-то общаются, гуляют, ходят на вечеринки, 20 лет-это золотые годы, самый рассвет юности. Встречаются с парнями. У меня нет даже намёка на это, поскольку в ВУЗе коллектив чисто женский и специальность тоже. На улицах на меня никто не смотрит, парни-ровесники смотрят будто сквозь меня, чувствую себя пустым местом. В последние годы стараюсь за собой ухаживать, слежу за внешним видом, делаю макияж, укладываю волосы. Но толку-ноль. Никому не нужна. А без макияжа у меня слишком детское лицо, выгляжу максимум лет на 16, и моё лицо очень некрасивое, некоторые проблемы с кожей, с сосудами, но прыщей слава Богу, нет. С 14 лет я начала встречаться с парнем, очень его полюбила, но потом он уехал в другой город, и два года подряд мы вели отношения на расстоянии, через Интернет. Когда мне было 16, он вернулся, мы повстречались четыре месяца, а потом он меня бросил, объяснив это тем, что скоро снова уедет, и устал от отношений по Сети. Он был моей первой любовью, секса у нас не было, но я крайне к нему привязалась эмоционально. Когда он меня бросил, я очень долго страдала, примерно до 18-19 лет. Не могла его забыть, часто посещала его профили в соц сетях, да и честно говоря, сейчас иногда могу сделать то же самое, тк мч у меня нет. Все мои одногруппницы давно встречаются, любят, естественно, у них есть секс. На меня же-никто даже и не смотрит, даже если я выйду на улицу с идеальным внешним видом. И друзей нет, кроме лучшей подруги, мне никто не пишет, не зовёт гулять, люди пишут мне только тогда, когда нужно что-то узнать или что-то сделать с моей помощью. Я устала так жить. Каждый мой день одинаковый с предыдущим. Я некрасивая закомплексованная неудачница. Понимаю, что с таким раскладом мыслей не добьюсь ничего в жизни. Я очень хочу семью, деток, хочу испытать настоящее чувство любви. Но боюсь, что в старости будет некому подать мне стакан воды... Пыталась изменить мысли, но через некоторое время ко мне возвращалось моё негативное восприятие мира. В школе тоже была замкнутой и необщительной. Выглядела неухоженной. В 8 классе из-за моей неуверенности в себе и внешнего вида, меня травили, объявляли мне бойкоты, унижали меня. Даже не только мой класс, а целых 4 класса. Может быть, эта душевная травма так и тянется до сих пор+обида на мужчин, из-за того, что меня бросил первый парень. В университете учусь на среднем уровне, (4-рки, иногда 5-рки, но есть и 3-ка,) тк начала лениться, хотя с моим временем, которое я провожу дома, можно было давно стать отличницей. Но школу закончила с золотой медалью, тк в то время была зациклена на учебе. Я хочу найти друзей, хочу отношений, но понимаю, что я полное ничтожество. Иногда я спрашиваю себя, для чего я живу, для чего я пришла сюда, в этот мир, раз в моей жизни нет смысла. Чтобы чувствовать постоянные страдания?.. Я пробовала обращаться к Богу, и в минуты молитвы мне становилось легче, но моя жизнь осталась прежней. У всех друзья, отношения, любовь, они гуляют, развлекаются, а что у меня?... Я понимаю, что мне уже целых 20 лет, и моя молодость проходит бесцельно. Думала, приду в университет и все изменится, но нет, я как была без друзей, так и есть. Мне никто не звонит, не пишет, я вообще не понимаю, для чего мне телефон. Глаза часто на мокром месте. В последние полгода начала всерьёз задумываться о самоубийстве, но до сих пор так и не решилась это сделать. Видимо, и для этого, я слишком слаба духом. Но я думаю  о способе как оборвать свою бесполезную жизнь. Единственное, что меня до сих пор держит здесь-это моя МАМА, которую я очень-очень люблю, я понимаю, что если уйду, и она умрет, я разобью ей сердце :( ведь я единственный ребёнок в семье. Но в то же время осознаю, что ещё чуть-чуть, и я все-таки сорвусь.....",
1," everyone. To begin with, my friends betray me. They do not just betray, but crush until tears flow from me. I'm kind by nature. How much betrayal I have forgiven can not be counted. My parents don't understand me. When I want to prove something, nothing good comes out. I am always to blame. I have already reached the point that I don't even have a girlfriend. Thank God that at least a normal relationship with most of the girls in the class. I used to be friends with 3 classmates. In difficult times, not one was around. And then I fell in love ... At first there was hope of reciprocity. But my friend won it. I roared at night. Thoughts were even about suicide. Mom didn’t want to give birth to me, and now she rarely calls at all (we live in different cities, I live with my relatives) ... Because of an absurd accident, they run into me with Mats. Nobody likes my appearance. But that's not the point. Sometimes I feel like an insignificant creature consuming air in vain. I'm always alone. I've been a walking dead lately. Circles under the eyes, glowering. Even my neighbor is now at 12 more beautiful than me, many guys love her. Sometimes, I guess the future. Then the same thing happens. I guess the fate, events. At first I thought it was special. No, elementary accidents. I just want to live a life, normal. I'm afraid this will never happen. I just don't talk to anyone. I think you will understand me.",
1,"! I decided to write here because I'm tired of such a life. Now I am 32 years old, and at this age usually there should already be a family, children, my own housing, a normal income and time to spend with my family. But for some reason, I have none of this. I have neither a normal job, and, accordingly, money, no personal life, despite the fact that I am a very attractive, caring and kind man. Despite this, all the girls with whom I was in a relationship turned their backs on me because I constantly have no money. It was painful to lose them, I loved them very much and always spoiled them when, after all, there was money. He filled up with flowers and toys, gave phones and tablets, gold, fed, dressed, drove and took away from work, gave money. There was a period in my life when my business brought in some money. Then came the crisis and the money suddenly disappeared. Without that, I always work hard like a horse, during the crisis I began to work even more and physically could not devote time to my beloved. Was completely at work. There was only one thought in my head: ""How and where to get money?"" Due to the lack of attention on my part, my mistress began to walk to the left. Suddenly I found out about it, it hurt. But even more terrible was the thought that now it was necessary to break off relations because of these betrayals. I loved her very much and tried to swallow it and forgive her. Did not work out. With each quarrel, betrayal surfaced. He himself began to change harshly, in the hope that this would help to accept her betrayal - it did not help, the pain of her betrayal did not go anywhere. We parted. Now she has a different relationship. And around me there are only those girls who want sex from me, but I do not consider them for a relationship. I'm completely crushed. Without friends, money, a loved one, work, with a bunch of debts and a loan for a car. And this has been going on for a very long time. I don't understand why my life is like this. I do not drink, go in for sports, take care of myself, constantly study and develop, hardworking, charming. I remember one case from my life - with the onset of the crisis, I decided to try to attract customers to my business by posting ads. He printed a very large volume of leaflets. For 2 weeks I was cutting phone numbers on pieces of paper with scissors. Then, leafing through the prayer book that my father gave me in the church, I came across a prayer ""for successful work."" Before posting leaflets, I read this prayer and went to post leaflets at night. I pasted them for about a month, every night, because by the day I was already busy with some orders. And you know, there was only one call from these leaflets, which in the end also fell through. After that, I took the cross off my neck and became an atheist. I don’t know why I’m failing. I don't know where to run from this. As if everyone was against me, no matter how hard I tried to change the situation. Suicidal thoughts are increasingly frequent. Constant calls from banks and from collectors make everything worse.",
1,"Since childhood, a loner. Mom raised her alone, relatives did not help. Then my mother gave birth to a sister from my stepfather when I was 11. I took care of her as if she were my child, because my stepfather received little and my mother worked a lot. At the same time, I managed to pass debts at school and be an excellent student, went in for athletics, and studied at a music school for 10 years, graduating with honors. Everything just not to be at home in hell. There were no friends, spread rot, tried to cut off the braid (it was up to the knees). At 18 she ran away with a guy, rented an apartment. I pulled for so long because of my sister, I knew that no one would do it. The period of freedom began, but for 4 years they were constantly starving, then living in a homeless woman, or not enough for medicine. Separately about health: throughout my life at home with my mother, I had nervous breakdowns, clinical depression, constant stress, due to which problems with the heart, blood vessels, teeth, tumors, etc. be nervous. Now we have been living with a guy for 4.5 years. Every 3 months we part. Both are to blame. Now again, although life seems to be getting better. But this time it's different, seriously.

1,"Уже очень давно я хочу покончить жизнь самоубийством, но что-то меня останавливает. Люди, окружающие меня, говорят, что моя жизнь самая лучшая, но они многого не знают. Всё началось с глубокого детства. С самых ранних лет родители от меня хотели очень много. Они говорили, что я должна учиться на отлично, заниматься спортом, ходить к куче репетиторов. Мне это не очень нравилось, ведь мне, как ребёнку, очень хотелось гулять во дворе, знакомиться с ребятами, вместе с ними проводить время, но из дома я почти не выходила. Я никогда ни с кем не могла найти общий язык, у меня было мало друзей. У меня всегда были достаточно хорошие результаты, но я не была сильно выдающимся ребёнком, я всего добивалась трудом, тем, что сидела дома и никуда не выходила. В детстве меня часто сравнивали с другими детьми, ругали и иногда били. Почти все меня предавали. Просто, чтобы иметь друзей, я делала всё для них, а они меня просто использовали. Но очень сильно на меня повлияли отношения в семье. Каждый день родители ссорились, папа орал на маму. А если я что-то говорила папе, он обижался на несколько месяцев и с нами не разговаривал. Я не помню того времени, когда папа жил с нами, я была очень маленькая. Где-то в пять лет я увидела папину переписку с какой-то любовницей. Папа также постоянно грубил маме и смеялся над ней. Папа зарабатывает достаточно много, и нам нужна его помощь. Просто, иногда я задумываюсь о том, что своё время и деньги он тратит не на любимую, родную семью, а на какую-то шл*ху. Папа приезжает только через неделю вечером. Мои родители часто меня унижали, из-за этого я чувствовала себя какой-то неполноценной. Они обижались на меня за четвёрки в четверти и требовали от меня только отличной учёбы. Но всё самое плохое началось в 7 классе. Я хотела быть крутой, красивой, чтобы меня уважали и хотели со мной дружить. Для этого я связалась с ""крутой"", не очень хорошей компанией. И естественно всё это не очень хорошо закончилось(я не курила, не пила, не ходила на вписки). Я немного забросила на учёбу, начала материться, прокрастинировать, сидеть всё время в интернете, засыпать очень поздно, начала сильно грубить родителям, начала резать руки. Ко всему этому пришёл переходный возраст, у меня начали появляться прыщи, а я люблю их повыдавливать и не могу остановиться, из-за этого я начала страдать, никакие средства не помогают, я всё время смотрю в пол, мало с кем разговариваю, не смотрю в глаза, редко выхожу на улицу, а мне так хотелось почувствовать себя красивой, у меня даже нет ни одной фотографии с возраста 12-13 лет. Только недавно у меня появился консиллер, но я всё равно хочу выглядеть нормально без косметики. Ещё я забросила весь спорт, немного потолстела, хоть я и вешу 46 кг, выгляжу я не очень красивой. Недавно папа наорал на маму, я начала её успокаивать, а она мне сказала, что хочет закончить жизнь самоубийством, но она понимает, что я ни кому не буду нужна. Недавно я узнала, что мой папа был осуждён до моего рождения, и я являюсь внебрачным ребёнком, и мои родители никогда не были расписаны. У меня больше нет сил, я всё время плачу, я хочу, чтобы вы мне помогли. Папу просить о помощи смысла нет, а маму я просила и разговаривала с ней, но ей самой нужна помощь, мне её очень жалко. Как можно просить помощи у человека, у которого самого в жизни нет позитива?",

Is it really possible after so many years in just a month to forget everything? Am I such a non-entity that it’s just such disrespect for me from the closest person. Honestly, I’ve been drinking for two weeks. I see only one way out, to leave forever. Probably you will think that I am a weakling, and I will agree with you!

I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia with the idea of ​​God as a tormentor, I tried to commit suicide for Him, but my mother took the knife away and said: “You can't, don't touch it,” and slapped me in the face, then I cried and fell to the floor. My parents took me to a psychiatric hospital and there they instilled on my brains that this was all that it was all not true, that I told them, I cried then strongly and screamed loudly. Then I was discharged from the psychiatric hospital and my mother now does not leave me, I became a Cinderella for her, I clean our entire sick house all day, she says that I should be busy and not think about stupid things and, on the contrary, I’ll then fly away to what some unknown space and there I am talking with someone otherworldly. I really don't know what to do. After my classmates found out that I wanted to commit suicide from the age of 14, they began to call me ""fool"" and ""dumb suicide"", but I could not do it, because I love my mother very much, and now they prescribed me medications to drink, but I Mom said: ""You won't drink this because you are strong,"" and I don't know what, but something is starting ... And for me the main question is: will my story end in suicide? I just don't know. Forgive me if there were mistakes, or if I strained you, but I really am in some kind of clouding of mind, I am very scared and bad, if you can help me with something, or advice, or just support, I will be very grateful ... I have no friends and girlfriends, after I was returned from the mental hospital (I was in the light department, where there were normal teenagers like me), then everyone refused me, but I can't find new friends. I love drawing and playing the piano, but my dad doesn't like how I play, he says it sounds ugly. I hate him for that. In general, I hate everyone and the whole world, for the fact that they treated me so that no one needs me and I am alone. I don't know who I want to become and who to grow up, it seems to me that nothing will come of it, and I will simply be put in the grave when I turn 18. My story is not a fiction or delirium, but no one believes me, because I am screwed up to everyone. At least you believe me, please, because I'm normal, but they make me crazy. Watch the series ""American Horror Story"" season two, there is about how a healthy girl was locked in a psychiatric hospital and made a psycho out of her, I have the same story and I'm just in shock and I don't know what to do. My parents do not care about me and they think that this is just teenage nonsense, but I really have some kind of nonsense in my life. How can I explain to them that I need the help of a specialist and their love and support? Why do they my parents don't care about me? Am I their daughter or did they take me out of the shelter?",

She creeps into my life .. everything I don’t do she talks about everything to my mother in a slightly different form (90% lies) And my mother believes her more than me although she knows what she is .. Recently my mother and I sat down to dinner. My sister hid the cheese that we bought and ate it herself (really, there is already a limit to hiding products), I found it and wanted to have dinner with it. My sister came and started yelling at me saying what I am, what kind of friends do I have that they don't count me as a person .. (she subscribed to my friends from a fake and followed me) and began to swear at me in front of my mother, I, having not remained in debt, began to answer her and threw a spoon at her. (cheerfully) And the fight began. Mom pulled us away and started yelling at her because she was to blame. Then she called me when my mother went as a prostitute, I climbed up to her again. Then my mother started yelling at me and kicked me out of the house. I do not understand why ? Why me? And not her .. Krch. My sister and I don't talk .. but every time we talk she tries to insult me ​​.. She shames me everywhere .. And when I try to answer my mother tells me to close my mouth. I don't understand at all. I'm tired of all this, you know? In another week, the exams if I write them badly, my mother will beat me up again and my sister will insult me ​​+ they will also take away the phone .. as they did in the 9th grade.

I became lonely and this emptiness in my heart is very painful, I began to eat a lot of sweets; to get rid of the pain, because of this, it became even fatter and uglier.

The father gave up as soon as he found out about the pregnancy, the mother was afraid to have an abortion at the first. She lived with her mother and stepfather and younger brother. As a child, I flew for everything in the world, by 18 they almost stopped beating, insulting and humiliating for everything - no. Mom has been depressed for many years, often cries herself, says that she hates her life. They often quarrel with their stepfather, even beat each other and try to strangle. But they don't get divorced. I often think about this situation, that the same thing awaits me, I am the same, I often take out my anger on my brother, although then I’m ready to kill myself for it. I'm just tired of living when everything is like that. My mother was also beaten and humiliated in childhood, and now she humiliates me and my brother, but for some reason he is rare, always me.

1,"In short: 26 years old. Modest, quiet, he was always on a leash with his parents. College, university by correspondence, everything for parents. I was in a relationship with girls once, at the age of 20 in the summer on vacation for 1 month and half a year of correspondence, then she could not stand it and left. I moved away from my parents, I thought I would live a new life, but no, I quickly realized that there were no friends left, everyone has a personal life, some already have children. I communicate with one girl from my previous job, which I like and for her I am only a friend. I am very depressed that there are no friends and the girls perceive me as a friend and turn me off, and indeed now I don’t know how to communicate with them, and even with people, I sit at home for days and I’m silent, my voice has become quieter, my stomach has appeared, my eyesight has fallen. Nothing interesting, all beginnings in sports, music, etc. ended with the fact that I was lazy and I threw everything. So I made a visa, went on a trip, I thought I would dispel, but it got worse. I liked the trip, of course, a different country, interesting, but all the time I walked with the thought that it was boring, that if my friends would be more fun and interesting. When I returned, I fell into depression from the thought that I was alone and that I would have to plow all my life, kill 11 months a year in order to go to earn money and go somewhere once. And on weekends to stay at home. I don’t have the strength and interest to do anything and play games on an easy difficulty level. I tried to look for an interesting job, but I can’t do anything and I didn’t find any vacancies for myself. It remains for the rest of your life to plow on dull, monotonous, boring work.

I don't know how to get myself out of this swamp, into which I drove myself. You need to pull yourself together, do something .., and then ask yourself the question: what, why? People around seem to be so happy, confident in themselves, in what they want from life, and I hang out all the time, and time is running out, if it's not gone ... it seems that it has gone. There were desires that I did not follow and spent many years on what I did not need, why. Now I live some strange life. Almost all alone. You wake up and every day is like groundhog day. Vicious circle. How to bring your thirst back to life. How to get up in the morning without a feeling of hopelessness .. I want to believe in myself, that I can still do something, I can fulfill my dreams, but it seems that this is already impossible.

There is a very nasty feeling inside, like self-loathing. The last straw was today's quarrel with my mother. We quarreled over my stupidity, but that doesn't make it any easier. Even if I admitted my mistake and apologized, nothing will change. She said: ""I wouldn't even be surprised if one day I get a dagger in my back from you"" ... Hearing this, I was completely disappointed in myself. Thoughts of death began to appear in my head. I even thought that it would be just wonderful if my heart just stopped at night and I could finally free myself from this oppressive feeling in my soul. I understand that even thinking about suicide is terrible, but I can’t help myself. I want to disappear from the memory of loved ones so that it would not hurt them to lose me.

1,"Я в своей жизни не вижу никакого просвета. С каждым днём лучше не становится, мотивации менять что-либо нет, если раньше у меня бывали вспышки надежды и я убеждала себя, что нужно бороться и всё выйдет - то теперь ничего не осталось. Слишком много раз я совершала попытки и ничего у меня не получалось. Не хватало воли, уверенности в себе, чьей-либо поддержки. Разочаровалась. Вот такой я человек слабовольный и легко поддающийся чужому мнению и влиянию. Я даже очень уменьшила требования к жизни, пыталась радоваться тому, что есть, но и это не помогло. Читала Библию, пыталась пустить Бога в душу. Становилось легче. Но на самом деле у меня нет даже минимума того, чему можно было бы радоваться. Я очень редко ем вкусную еду, дом у меня ужасный, еще и от города далеко. Нет образования. Нет работы. Были проблемы с алкоголем: теперь благодаря этому у меня множество психологических проблем вдогонку, тревожность на ровном месте и плохой сон. Чувство вины за свой прошлый образ жизни и огромный стыд перед собой не дают покоя и каждую секунду не выходят из головы негативные воспоминания. Не могу принять и простить себя за то поведение. Всё, что овтлекало меня до сих пор - онлайн-игра на компьютере. Вчера решила поставить точку, потому что игра отнимает всё моё время, но сегодня думаю - а зачем? Может, вернуться? Всё равно в жизни мне уже ничего не нужно, а так хоть быстрее скоротаю время до неизбежного. Целей нет,  даже краткосрочных. Разочаровалась абсолютно в главной цели моей прошлой жизни,  любви - в нашем мире её нет. Каждый лишь использует другого, сначала говорит, что до конца с тобой, а потом и не поздоровается на улице. Не хочу ни с кем знакомиться, никому не доверяю. Да и шансов найти партнера у меня нет, так как я не хочу детей с 14 лет. Мои взгляды на традиционные ценности не совпадают с большинством людей. Ну и зачем я нужна такая ""бракованная?"" Я никогда не смогу получить радости от жизни, потому что  в ней для меня радостей нет. Я выдумываю себе миры в голове и часто живу там. Там я достигла чего-то, там есть люди, которым я нужна. У меня даже есть вымышленные друзья, с которыми мне нравится посоветоваться и побеседовать. Там всё как в фильмах и книгах, есть настоящее чувство долга, приключения, любовь, самопожертвование. Реальность отравляет меня, мне она абсолютно не нравится. Но она так или иначе напоминаете о себе всеми способами. Когда у тебя нет ни на что денег особенно. Когда сидишь в своей конуре перед устаревшим компьютером, ешь пустые макароны и тихо ненавидишь себя. А желания менять что-либо уже просто нет. Мне просто стало наплевать, я плыву по течению. Работу я даже искать уже не хочу, устала за год перескакивать каждую неделю с одной на другую и получать требования работать по 12 часов за 150 гривен. Поддержки ни от кого нет тоже, предоставлена сама себе. А сама себя я не вытяну, я знаю точно. Потому что я мнительная, апатичная, нервная, неуверенная в себе и никогда не могу закончить начатое. И ничего во мне больше нет, кроме склонности витать в облаках, такой себе обреченный безнадежный романтик. Однажды я чуть не утонула в детстве, и сейчас не понимаю, почему этого не произошло. Зачем вот так жить, когда в почти 24 ты не сдвинулся с места?",

I live like an amoeba, constantly depressed, constantly thoughts of suicide. In general, I I only think about this and not only think about it. There have been attempts already. Many attempts. Unsuccessful. There are also enough cuts on my hands. Constant panic attacks and bouts of auto-aggression. I read such stories and notice that some reason pushes all people to suicide. the girl left, someone has no health or money, someone is pushed to this loneliness ... I honestly don't even remember what happened. I had all this and have. All the time I was sick with something. Always. With tasks that life puts in front of me I never cope. And I also interfere with people. I interfere with my presence, conversations. But I have more of those here whose interests are reduced to drunkenness and hiking by registration. I don’t talk to them. At school I only listen to stories about who drank with whom yesterday, who smoked weed and who vomited afterwards. And at school in general, everyone only bullied , including teachers. I have a favorite thing that I’m really interested in doing, but it doesn’t save me from these thoughts. I almost don’t go to the street, because I just can’t look at these couples and companies of happy people who are with friends or with even a girl. The mood immediately deteriorates from this. I don't even want to talk about the relationship. And so everything is clear. The most necessary people always said something like “you are very cool, but I don’t need you.” I was terribly worried and freaked out because of this, and now I don't understand why I needed them then. I'm already used to such things. And all these concepts ... such as love, mutual understanding does not mean anything to me. I no longer believe that there is a person who will not leave and will not replace Someone else. All these are just words. I sleep badly. Or rather, I hardly sleep. Still, everything falls out of my hands, I gasp for breath when I'm nervous. And I get nervous quite often (even now), because there are enough reasons. I hate myself for being too sentimental. it will remind me that I have a family. Parents are all there. But they just laugh and And about me and my problems. They really love to make fun of me in front of the public, and the public (whatever it is) always agrees with them. Most of all, it's a shame that for this worthless existence you have to constantly fight every day. I will never believe that life is beautiful. I know her as she is. If there was something good, then it’s clear how it ended. In life you can rely only on yourself. I understood this, so I always keep everything to myself. I try not to show your true feelings, but it does not always work out. I myself am not a believer, but lately I think that this is how God punishes me for all my sins. I’m not even scared that I’ll go to hell. I’m just tired of all this nightmare. And if I don’t all become Much better. This I know for sure.

Я очень верила в Бога и пыталась искать пользу в своих страданиях и становится чище и лучше.только со временем я поняла ,что это был побег в духовность от реальной жизни с которой я не справилась .но самая жесть - это фобия и невозможность жить полноценной жизнью,это разрушило мою жизнь.я не могла с ней справится а меня никто не понимал .и не понимает .и осуждают ))))))потому что я долгих 4 года почти в любом начинании терпела поражения .я живу в комнате 12 квадратов и у меня за неё долг больше года - т почти все это время я вру.вру что работаю на работе и тп хотя пытаюсь зарабатывать сама,потому что я не могу преодолеть свою неадекватность - меня настигает паника когда я с кем то вынуждена находится в замкнутом пространстве. А мои дела столько раз проваливались ,что на мне давно висит ярлык неудачника.мне 27.лучшие годы ушли вот на это.я ненавижу себя особенно за долг и страх остаться на улице.я живу в этом стыде и страхе уже так давно и моих сил нет.ничего не меняется.самый подвох знаете в чем ?что моя личная сила проявляется именно в живую ,я очень обоятельный человек, другие мной вдохновляются не подозревая что внутри я труп ))))и вот я совсем не могу использовать то,что мне дано природой.я сижу как в тюрьме.ежедневная борьба за выживание. Мне даже приходилось воровать в магазине еду некоторое время назад...себе и коту.как можно уважать такого человека который не может себе обеспечить жизнь ?это ужасно.такие люди не должны жить,т.к они не приспособлены.но самая жесть это конечно ощущение предательства бога.я очень верила и любила всей душой.но я устала ,потому что в мой жизни бог почему то в образе бездушного садиста и по моим ощущениям он ждёт моей смерти и ждёт чтоб я это сделала сама.парадокс в том что если во мне раньше это желание подсознательно сидело ,то некоторое время назад я наоборот захотела жить.но он как будто говорит - нет,не хотела - вот тебе все условия иди в мир иной.у меня нет воли к жизни больше потому что я потеряла веру что что то может изменится .у меня был и кризис смысла и тп,но сейчас это совсем другое.я чувствую себя давно лишней в этом мире и хочу просто уже тихонечко его покинуть.точнее я вижу это как единственно возможную траекторию своего жизненного пути .я всегда была очень добрым человеком и мне было хорошо помогать людям и тп....сейчас я понимаю что даже это потеряло смысл.у каждого своя жизнь.иногда я чувствую себя куском враждебности - ненавижу мир и людей за то что они могут жить а я нет.короче я вчера попробовала посм на себя со стороны и я считаю что моя партия давно разыграна.все.и воли нет уже.внутри меня какая то часть радуется этому выбору и эта часть сильнее менее,ну по крайней мере у меня нет не желания ни сил ей противостоять - только вместе с собой я смогу её убить.хотя я дала себе некоторый срок и я надеюсь что бог решит этот вопрос ....он никогда не слышит меня я надеюсь что услышит сейчас ....Либо нет его ,либо он садист в моей жизни - я уверена что у каждого своё представление.просто я если не убью себя то чувствую что с ума могу сойти ,а это ещё страшнее .психика не выдерживает ",
1,"Too many things piled on. I tried very hard to study all year. Moving from one end of Russia to another (to an island ... a small homeland, so to speak) in the middle of the school year, of course, shook a little, but I still threw all my strength into study. I need a budget because. my parents are unlikely to provide for me at all. At home, there are eternal screams at me and humiliation for any reason, let alone frequent beatings .. Therefore, I want to leave here back to the mainland as quickly as possible. The only way out was to get a free place in the university and earn extra money in their free time in order to support themselves. Now I found out that I scored 61 points on the exam (which I should have written well) ... I am broken and feel that this is the end. Even if I score more or less points on others, then I’ll hardly go to the budget. I feel destroyed. I am working now to save up for a ticket, but where will I go? I have nowhere to run. I don't want to live. Study was my everything. I really thought I could do it. I thought that if I tried, everything would work out. And now I understand that no matter what I do, I will not achieve anything. Nothing will happen. No good job, no education ... There are no good universities here. And I will not be able to get such a level of education here so that later I can work on the mainland. There I have friends and opportunities. Opportunities for growth and movement forward, because my dream is to become a human being. Personality. And not to depend on the mood of my parents, who can kick me out of the house onto the street at any moment, but I can no longer do anything. I can not. Just because my strength wasn't enough. And no matter how hard I try, it doesn't change. Nothing will happen anymore. Nothing. Forgive me for saying all this and, perhaps, it all sounds pathetic, I just want to speak at least to someone.",
1,"! I did not think that I would ever write on such forums, but I wanted to speak ... now I'm 23 years old. This year I graduated from a university, I work in a prestigious job, in general, I always set myself goals: to finish school with a gold medal, get an education, get a good job - all this I gradually achieved, but ... I did not live, I missed my years I didn’t enjoy them in full just because I said to myself: I must, I must, I must learn, I must pass, I must work. Everything passed by. It's hard for me to get along with people, but it's even harder to part with those to whom I'm used to. I still don't have a girlfriend, just because I'm not sure of myself - there was no practice, there was no time, or maybe these are all worthless excuses ... For a year now I have made several friends, such as I can rely and whom I am ready to help at any moment, and I - I value friendship. A friend is, in a sense, the opposite of me: I believe that he looks better outwardly, he is fit, how many girls he has, how many stories - the man spent these years as it should. He became an example for me to many features, I began to look closely, to study - so far to no avail. But at the same time, listening to his stories, looking at how confident he feels with girls and how they look at him - an absorbing sadness rolls over me ... Now I just want to find a soul mate ""to my liking"" to give my care , my love, protection, but I can't even start a relationship. It seems like a tangled circle. Tomorrow will be a new day, after work I will come tired to my modest rented apartment and fall on the sofa - and everything will happen again",

1," ladies and gentlemen. Oddly enough, I wanted to ask for help. The fact is that my classmates are cruelly mocking me. It all started in 4th grade. I was friends with two girls, Lisa and Kira. We got along well and everything was fine. Lisa was the most popular girl in the class, in other words, tp. She was and is the queen of our class. In grade 4, I began to get involved in drawing and Japanese animation, briefly anime (I ask all anti-anime people not to write in the comments something like ""fuuuu, anime, right classmates are doing what they are bullied"", etc. I came for help and not behind it). And so, I began to share with them my joys, about the release of a new series of my favorite anime, about my drawing better, etc. They are tired of it. They are tired of listening to me. They began to be rude to me, saying something like ""how are you tired"" or ""when will you be quiet?"" At this time, we were still friends. Then I got my first depression. And one day, they came to me and said that they were tired of me and no longer needed. Then it was a shock for me. From a sociable girl I turned into a withdrawn, taciturn, depressive and shy present me. From that day on, they every day spread rot, humiliated me, etc. Due to the fact that they are the most popular, they began to ""order"" my other classmates to beat, humiliate and insult me.

Lately I feel myself in front of a huge iron wall. In just a few years, I turned from a demanded specialist into an unnecessary scarecrow. I am trying to implement my projects, but everything is stuck. All my acquaintances and friends have somehow settled their lives. And they live quietly. What pleases. But I have all the difficulties. All this is attached to the family mess. My father happily scored on my existence. And it seems only glad of my failures. Mother has her own life and my condition in general does not bother her much. I helped my wife with her career. And now she has more important problems than me. Daughter, though happy. But the question often arises, what can I give her and what can I teach her?

But everything is steady, the feeling that I am doing something wrong is being visited more and more often ... And I would have seen my goals for a long time, and I have been working by profession since I was fifteen. And still there is no realization. It feels like I'm just sitting and degrading. And after all, I really always helped people when possible. I pulled a lot of people out of the loop, I arranged a lot, and in general I'm not a bad guy. Never left people in trouble. And there were quite a few such cases ... No education, even from the field of psychology, helps to get rid of terrible thoughts, scrubbing the soul, burning out the soul. As if I no longer belong to myself. I don't influence anything and I can't do anything !!! I feel lonely and unnecessary. I just hate myself For It !!! Everyone is used to seeing me strong. They think I can do it myself. Very tired ... Depressed and devastated. Words cannot convey everything. As if not alive, not dead. This issue should be fundamentally resolved. But I will say one thing. For some time now, my gaze increasingly falls on pills. And there at least the grass does not grow xD. ""Is it worthy? To resign itself under the blows of fate, or to resist? And in mortal combat with a whole sea of ​​troubles, end them. Die?"" In truth, man's worst enemy is himself. Sorry about all this.

This is my first relationship, since no one before that could so captivate and interest me. Fell in love madly and this love is mutual. But things got worse last summer.

This means that my mood can change up to 10 times a day, from a suicide attempt to a persistent (in quotes) desire to live. My depression has been going on for 2 years. For 2 years, almost every day I remember death, apathy paralyzes me, inexplicable anxiety and fear appear. It's scary that this life will never be happy for me. It's scary that no one will love me, I look at my classmates and see that they are married, they already have children, they travel around the seas, post happy photos on Instagram. They are beautiful and successful. And I work in a low-paying job that I don't like, I study, and I'm afraid that I can never be what I want to become.

It seems that I will never have a family, a favorite job, or a job, but no one will love me, and I cannot live like that. I have never had a sexual experience at my age and I am ashamed. Although there were even people who said that I looked good, I did not like them. Were not beautiful enough, smart, successful, I could not love them.

Although it seemed that there was only a road to hell. No goals are helping now. Because love cannot be defeated. Knowing that you may never again experience these feelings in the future, you will never be happy as the people around you, and everyone around you will condemn you for your loneliness.

Either I myself found meetings with him, or he began to write to me. Now he is thousands of kilometers away from me, he left to build a career.

If he is, then he definitely forgot about me. I cannot stand such tests. Nobody should be alone, everyone should have a half. Without this, the meaning of life is simply lost. What a person would not achieve. You can build a career if you really want to, but in your personal life this is not at all the case. And I don't feel like a girl. Or did I not deserve love?

There was a psychological trauma - this is the loss of a loved one. I opened my soul to her, although I myself did not know what was going on there. .And then it started. Reconsideration of all life. Then only opened my eyes to this harsh world. The fact is that I did not live in reality, I lived in my little world, I dreamed a lot, I felt safe there.

It was as if some kind of infirmity had fettered me; I could not do anything. I do not work, I am not able to walk with children, and if I force myself literally by force. going outside, I get tremendous stress. I find thousands of reasons not to go out with children today. I recovered terribly, although we eat poorly and poorly, I cannot even walk for a long time, I have become so fat. I only have enough to feed the children, make sure they are clean, and do a few things around the house so as not to get muddy. Every morning I force myself to get out of bed forcibly. If it weren't for the children, then I probably would have lain all day, and maybe more than one day. I wait for the day to pass so that I can go to bed with a great feeling of relief And the next morning the nightmare begins again And so day after day ... I cannot find a job, although I worked all my life before, but after maternity leave I suddenly became so not sure of to myself that no one is taking me to work anywhere, not to mention the fact that having children also frightens off the employer. The debts are huge. I started selling things from home to buy groceries. And even a clear awareness of the catastrophe, the understanding that I have derailed life with my own hands, as well as the lives of my children, does not give me an incentive to do something, I feel some kind of direct physical powerlessness and lack of confidence in my own abilities. I see no way out of the vicious circle. the presence of children scares away employers, and if they start working, they will be kicked out after the first sick leave. there is no one to transfer children, I am completely alone. I see no way out at all. After all, no one will agree to sit with my children on a permanent basis, except for a nanny for whom there is no money. and this is the main condition for getting a normal job. I would not hesitate to die, but it’s scary to leave children orphans and useless. I hate myself, but I cannot overcome the circumstances, no matter how hard I fight. hence my apathy.

1," members of the forum !!! I am writing in the hope of speaking out or something ... When I met her (hereinafter the ex-wife of the BZ), here it is (I was 28 years old, she was 25). After all, I prayed so much to God that he would send me a girl (wife), then I really wanted to get married. Moreover, they met by chance, after which you will directly believe in the higher powers in heaven. In the process of the candy bouquet period, she showed her not simple character. But then I did not notice it and was in a fog. And if there were quarrels, then somehow he did not solve them, he closed up (I’m not used to living like that, I love calmness, silence), and there were a lot of quarrels. This is how we lived for 5 years, a daughter was born whom I love very much. Living in a marriage, because of frequent quarrels, I began to smoke a lot, work plus business trips could not find a place for myself, I was constantly in tension. And after another quarrel, I said that I wanted to get a divorce, for her it was a shock, although it all went for years. He explained that I cannot live with such a character, constantly on my nerves. I left lovingly from her, not to her mistress, not to drink or to fornicate, I just didn't want my daughter to see our curses. Half a year has passed, but I realized where I was wrong, where I had to make decisions myself, then another. Well, I don’t understand why the BZ doesn’t want to admit its mistakes, I thought that the feelings would cool down and it would fit and we would somehow discuss with a cool head where she was where I was wrong. But instead I took another boyfriend away from her, they probably have a wedding soon. When I learned this, I almost fainted. Wasn't it better for her to find someone else right away instead of restoring relations with me, especially since there is a child. Yes, I agree that I betrayed her, she knew that I left loving her, but ... A year has passed since the breakup. Now at work everything is fine with me, everything is getting better, there are goals, I go to the sports section, I attend church. I apologize for her and myself from God for not being able to become a support for her, a man with a capital letter, I could not put up with such a character, I simply could not. I am writing this and almost in tears I sit. I still love her, but with such a difficult character. As for attempts to return her or go to a meeting, I tried, but ended up in a scandal and reproaches against me. Forgive me, God gave it to me but .......................................... I COULD NOT. I do not want to live, maybe a second chance for marriage from God to ask, I see no reason if this one wasted. Thanks who read",

1,"Good day. For about five years I have been in a depressed state with a desire to die. Sometimes in life there were flashes of light, but they were so fleeting and saved only for a while. Everything else is endless reflections, feeling superfluous and lack of meaning in life. It all started in childhood, when my father started drinking, which led to constant quarrels between him and his mother. And then my father raped me, then my brother did it. I became even more withdrawn, there were great difficulties in communication with both adults and peers. In adolescence, it became even more difficult: there were no friends as such, and my person was a target for ridicule. How many times I wanted to commit suicide, but held back, only cut my limbs out of resentment and pain. I entered the university: not the one that I wanted, not the specialty that attracted me. But I thought that life would get better with the move from the village to the capital. Nothing like this. All the same feeling of worthlessness, all the same unwillingness to live. But by the end of the first year, changes suddenly take place: friends appear and with the beginning of spring the love of life awakens. It turned out that not everything is so simple: soon, on one of the spring evenings, when I was returning home, they attacked me with the aim of beating and rape, which, in fact, they did. Then - a week in the hospital, the police, a house, and being on autopilot without any sense of even the slightest sense of it. A year has passed since then, but I still cannot recover. And the point is not even the last incident, but the fact that the feeling of hatred and feeling like a miserable loser left behind in this life is intensifying. I'm tired of the world, but especially of myself. And I feel scared for my future, because I just can't get my thoughts together and start doing something. Constantly gnawing at envy of other people and self-hatred, which I want, but believe it or not, I can not overcome. And I don't know how to live on.",

Life has lost all meaning, I go with the flow and wait where it will take me. This is not the life I imagined.

1,"Every day I think about suicide more and more often, I'm tired of everything to the point of madness, I'm 26 years old, I got married early, at first everything was great, my husband looked after nicely, went on business trips, earned good money, a daughter was born all worries were on me my husband rarely appeared, then drinking when he drank became a rude, cruel person could humiliate, hit. At first I forgave, he apologized, said that it would not happen again, I believed, forgave, then more and more often his drinking began. We live with my grandmother, she has a terrible character, we often quarrel, she demands money for an apartment every month, whether they are independent or not, he lives separately with my mother according to the will of my father, but they have their own life, a little sister, so there is no help, and grandmother tells me how to live and how to raise a child, constantly pokes the fact that her apartment and I am nobody here, if I start to say that I will raise my daughter myself, she starts calling my father, and he, in turn, says that if you don’t obey grandmother, then get out from the apartment, many times offered her husband to rent an apartment, but he is against it, supposedly spending extra money and everything like that. Recently, everything has become unbearable, at home pressure from all sides, my husband on business trips began to drink more and more often when they drink, I began to hear women's voices, over the course of 8 years of marriage, he lowered my self-esteem below the plinth, began to say that no one needs me, that I insignificance, I won't get away from him, there is also no pressure to go home at home, I don't want to rent an apartment or even a room, my salary does not allow me to get another job, too, I can’t give my daughter time, in general, a vicious circle of no support, I want to apply for divorce but I can't decide, my husband instilled that no one needs me, although I'm quite a pretty girl with a good figure, recently my husband said I won't calm down until I bring you to the loop, it was in a drunken state, but I feel that this is all, I'm tired of everything !",
1,"Sometimes it seems to me that I was replaced. I was a cheerful, active, proactive and kind girl, but then something happened. First, the moral strength ran out, then one by one the problems began to pile up: quarrels, a possible cancer of a friend (it was not justified, it turned out to be another, not a fatal disease), the father's alcoholism, the mother's move to another city, the feeling that I was superfluous in my father's house and stepmothers who were constantly unhappy with me, like friends, although I tried as best I could. The guy was also unhappy with me and left me, because I am rude to him and do not work on relationships, as well as ""build a wall from him."" Simply put, he simply could not stand my new, terrible character. I can't communicate, I dropped out of school, because in the morning I can't get out of bed and sleep all day, I lost all my friends, because I became angry and silent, I began to break down at everyone. I also know that if I fall for my stepmother, I will be kicked out to live with my stepfather, to whom I am not at all a close person, even morally, I am terribly afraid of him. My father got drunk and drove me to hysterics, the wrestling classes I used to go to, I temporarily left because I can't see my ex and how happy he is (selfishly, yes, I know). Now I will never be able to put on a swimsuit, because there are scars on my legs, and I am a whore, because I changed 5 guys in a year and slept with four, one of whom I did not even know. Soon, no one will need me, they will kick me out of college with such an education, and from home with such an attitude towards people. I am very scared for my future, inside me there is just emptiness and anger at myself, there is not even sadness left. My life seems to me to be a prolonged nightmare, but I cannot leave it either - I am afraid and feel sorry for my relatives. I don't know how to live on, because I already tried to open my veins while drunk, I was stopped by my boyfriend at that time. I tried to find a psychologist, but I am from a poor family, there is no money for good, but I ran away from a social worker - he was barely older than me, and it turned out to be unbearable to talk about my feelings. My heart and head hurt all the time against the background of constant hassle, and I'm just not happy about anything. If life is like that, then I don't want to live.",

I am nothing. Since childhood, they considered me capable, but because of my own laziness in adolescence, I lost everything. I entered a university that I don't like, a specialty I don't want to study. I don't know what I want at all. I would lie with a book and not see anyone or anything. Absolute apathy. She abandoned her studies. Got fat, although a year ago she lost a lot of weight. All I do is eat, sleep or lie on the bed. A freak that nobody wants. Mom believes in me, but I do nothing and cannot do anything. She hopes that something will come out of me, and I'm a complete disappointment. I don't want to live like this. I'm tired of myself",

I want to die in this second, because everything in this world, in my life, is so entangled that if it were a ball of threads, it would fall into the clutches of a playing kitten, who has played only with this ball for all its 9 lives. I am married, and my husband does not understand me, everything around me puts pressure on me, because everyone who surrounds me, they interfere with my development. Since childhood, I need to listen to the advice of my parents, who did not give me a proper education, because it is not in our tradition to get an education. And now my husband, whom I also have to listen to, and to whom I have to obey, is bothering me. I can't even cry from my impotence. I may want too much, but I would have achieved this if at least one dear person had supported me. And now my state of mind is more like a black hole. There is nothing in me, I am closed and I want more loneliness than support. I want more death than colorful life. And I don't want to see any of my relatives. I don't hate anyone. I love everyone, but it annoys me that they climb to me. They ask about something. I want to become invisible. And most importantly, I don’t know whether I want to become invisible anymore or just die from a disease that may soon strike me .. a disease from which there is no cure yet, except to maintain a person's existence, but not life. And if a choice appears before me, now I would choose death rather than existence and torment not only for me, but also for my environment",

1,"For the last 5 years I have been feeling very bad. It’s like a lump of dirt stuck in my chest and eating away at me from the inside. I have not wanted anything for 5 years. No sex, no work (which I just stopped liking), watching movies, walking, talking and in the end, living too. Every day I come to work, communicate with workmates, pretending that everything is in order, smiling in their face, joking with them, and when I come home I turn on the music and lie and listen. I just listen and dream of dying or being born in another century. But there is no one to tell the truth to. Parents have been divorced since 2010. Relations with them are cold as ice. My father demands a lot from me, what I don't want, I don't like. But I have to do so as not to disappoint him and in the end I still make a mistake somewhere and disappoint him. Maybe I miss love or something else that I do not see and do not realize? At home too, I just stopped cleaning, I live like ... but I just live like I live. Don't give a damn about everything. I want to scream, so loudly that they would hear on the other side of the universe. Why does it hurt so much? Why so bad? What is wrong with me? I am 28 years old, and I feel at all 80. I will say this if it were not for Mom, Dad, I would have committed suicide <ed. Mod.> ... Lord, how bad it is at heart. I would like to write so much here, but vryatli it will help me in some way, vryatli will give me spirit and strength to live on. People will read what I have written and many will think. What a moron. Or just sympathize with me. And I just don't care. I want to free myself from life. I want to jump off the plane and just fly to the bottom with my eyes closed and know that just a couple more moments of flight and I will be free. I have no one to complain to, no one to tell how bad I am, no one to cry on my shoulder and this is probably sad from the point of view of a normal person. I understand that suicide is not an option. And it won't be easier for the family. But I didn't even care about my family. I am scared of these thoughts. This is probably the first and last time I write something on the Internet.",

A year and a half ago I met a boy who was much older than me, so there could be no talk about relations, in this regard, we became best friends, but he did not know about my feelings. We have gone through a lot, both bad and good, and tomorrow this same guy goes to the army, to the city of St. Petersburg, which is 1200 km from my city, and a week later my best friend goes to the army, without them it will be crazy hard. But this is not so bad. I have no relationship with my parents: my mother constantly yells, makes her do absolutely everything around the house, cook, clean, and so on, although at that time she herself goes to drink with her friends. I never considered my father a father, he is like a stepfather to me, he himself always goes into lock up, beats me, etc. The elder brother lives in Moscow, he does not consider me a person at all, does not even greet me, I am just an empty place for him. My parents don’t give me money for anything, they buy clothes once a year at best, and it’s simply unrealistic to find work in our city. This morning, my mother accused me of stealing 5,000 rubles from her, although I did not, after which she beat me and sent me to all four sides, my father immediately said that it was me, you see, no one else had to take, say that I'm shocked to say nothing. Why did I start with a story about the army? Yes, because in all my family situations I was helped by exactly those two people who now go far away. Every evening I came to them and just cried. They only gave me money because they knew about all the problems. Mom will come back from the beauty salon and start hacking me up again because of the money I did not take.

1,"Хеллоу, что сказать жизнь не была не особенно хороша в последнее время, если она вообще когда либо была прекрасной. Меня зовут Алиса, мне 14 лет. Я всю жизнь прожила с мамой и бабушкой в маленьком городке. Популярностью никогда не пользовалась и просто ненавидела всех своих сверстников. Они казались мне мерзкими и абсолютно одинаковыми. Мама вечно работала чтобы нас прокормить. Меня любил только один человек на Земле-это моя бабушка Зоя. Она была особенной. Мама влазила в долги и в один прекрасный момент влезла в них так, что выбраться было уже не возможно. У бабушки обострились все заработанные за жизнь заболевания. Летом 2016 она перенесла ешемический инсульт. Мы с мамой еле справились с этим как в финансовом плане, так и в моральном. Мама ночевала с бабулей в больнице, а я одна дома в другом районе. За две недели у меня появилась привычка гулять до поздна. Так в один день, гуляя, я познакомилась с парнем. Звали его Женя. Я очень скованная и робкая девушка. Я считала себя настолько красивой чтобы&#8203; нравится парням. Но Женя в буквальном смысле сделал все за меня. У нас завязалась дружба. Мы частенько гуляли вместе. Однажды, в один прекрасный вечер он сказал мне что я ему нравлюсь. Я ответила взаимностью. Сразу же после этого я захотела все рассказать кому то. У меня была лучшая подруга Николь. Я любила ее и доверяла ей. Я побежала к Николь и рассказала ей обо всем. Она была очень рада за меня и взяла с меня обещание познакомить ее с Женей в подходящее время. Никогда я ещё не была так счастлива. А с Женей у нас все было хорошо. Я никогда не забуду свой первый поцелуй. Это случилось вскорее после его признания. Вечером 13 сентября, в парке. Мы встречались уже 2 месяца. Я никогда не испытывала ничего подобного. Но счастье мое длилось не долго. Николь все ещё настаивала на их знакомстве с Женей. Я с ним поговорила, он тоже был не против. И мне пришлось их познакомить. 3 ноября, я никогда не забуду этот день. Все шло хорошо. Николь и Женя подружились. Я была рада таким обстоятельствам. Близился январь. Все новогодние праздники мы провели вместе (я, Женя, Николь и Костя - друг Жени?) Нам было весело. Я даже намекнула на то, что было бы неплохо если бы Николь и Костя были вместе. Моя подруга закатила глаза и сказала: "" Лиса, что за бред?"" Каникулы закончились. Наступил мой день рождения! Я пригласила только Женю и Николь - самых близких мне людей. Дальше я плохо помню подробности. Женя ушел в туалет, а потом вслед за ним ушла и Николь. Их долго не было, поэтому я пошла посмотреть все ли у них хорошо. Дверь в ванную комнату была открыта. Я зашла и спросила: "" Ребята, что то вы долго, я..."" В этот момент внутри меня все оборвалось. Мой парень, моя первая любовь, целовал мою лучшую подругу. Я плакала... Это все что я помню. Вскорее после этого у бабушки случился второй инсульт, который она уже не пережила. Жизнь забрала у меня самых родных мне людей. Тогда мир перестал существовать. Я хотела только одного. Умереть. Уйти из жизни. Мамы не было дома. Я (...)Я очнулась в больнице. Потом все случилось быстро. Меня выписали. Мы с мамой уехали в большой город. Мама работает, я учусь и регулярно посещаю психолога. Все таки хорошо что все так закончилось. А что на счёт Николь и Жени, я с ними больше не общалась, я не хотела ничего о них слышать, но кажется они счастливы вместе, так что все хорошо.",

1,"Здравствуйте. Мне 31 год. Скоро 32. И я устала бороться за своё будущее. Мысли о суициде посещали меня с подросткового возраста, а вообще наверное и раньше. В детстве, когда родители ссорились, я уходила в комнату, утыкалась носом в подушку и старалась перестать дышать. В своём доме я не чувствовала себя нужной никому. Но были родственники, бабушки с дедушками, общение с которыми приносило радость. Жизнь была какой-то цикличной.Я была старшим ребёнком в многодетной семье, папа часто пил и устраивал ссоры. Мама уходила в себя, плакала, изо всех сил старалась тянуть нас, детей. Когда я подросла, я стала заступаться за неё перед отцом,что очень сильно обострило наши с ним отношения. Лет в 13-14 у нас с отцом произошла сильная ссора, он меня избил и сказал, чтобы я собирала вещи и выметалась из дома в течение 15 минут. Я собралась и уехала жить к бабушке с дедушкой, которые и так меня поддерживали с самого детства. Я переживала за своих сестёр и брата, оставшихся жить с родителями в такой тяжёлой обстановке. Родители, в конечном итоге, развелись, но уже спустя годы. Мама после моего ухода стала искать психологов и обратилась в группу для родственников зависимых людей. Я долго не могла простить родителей: отцу - агрессию и издевательства,словесные и физические; маме - то, что она за меня не заступалась. Я жила с родителями папы, никто из моих друзей и однокурсников в институте не знал ничего о моей истории, тема моей семьи была табу. На меня периодически находили депрессивные состояния. Однажды отец приехал к бабушке, чтобы забрать меня. Я настолько не хотела возвращаться, что с разбегу чуть не выпрыгнула с балкона.  Это был сиюминутный порыв, в голове отключилось всё, я просто побежала,даже не успев обдумать возможные последствия. При выходе на балкон меня поймал дедушка и крепко сжал, никогда этого не забуду. Папе меня не отдали. Отношения с ним на протяжении многих лет оставались очень тяжёлыми. Потом была неудачная подростковая любовь и тоже мысли о самоубийстве. Я несколько раз стояла на краю скалы,но так и не решилась прыгнуть. Однажды в нескольких метрах от себя,на скале, я увидела парня. Он тоже стоял на краю и смотрел вниз.Длительное время. Мне стало страшно,что если я прыгну, он по инерции может сделать то же самое. Это меня остановило. Я не стала с ним знакомиться. Но мы оба ушли с того края,каждый своей дорогой. Ещё была подруга, преодолевшая рак. Общение с ней вдохновляло меня жить. Тем не менее, депрессивные состояния в течение жизни накатывают с определённой периодичностью, и кажется, что выхода нет. Особенно тяжело было после смерти дедушки, во время болезней детей, перед каждым экзаменом в ВУЗах, во время ухода мужа. Бывают моменты, когда перед глазами как-будто чёрная пелена, я виню себя в том, что не сложилась моя собственная семья. Когда дети уезжают к бабушкам и я остаюсь в одиночестве, всё яснее ощущается отсутствие желания жить. Я теряю аппетит, сон. Плачу и не могу остановиться. Иногда эти состояния доходят до крайностей, кажется, что и детей моих лучше воспитал бы другой, более удачливый человек. Я виню себя в том, что у меня не получается толком ничего им дать, что я испортила их детство нищетой, переездами, ссорами и разъездом с мужем. Что не сохранила семью. Периодически у меня болит голова и сердце. Я успокаиваю себя, заверяю, что я должна бороться дальше, до победного, за лучшую жизнь. Но иногда так хочется всё бросить. Поставить жирную точку. Исчезнуть и не быть ни для кого ""плохой"", проблемой, обузой, человеком, ничего особо не добившимся в жизни и не сумевшем сохранить свою семью...    ",

1,"Здравствуйте. Не знаю даже с чего начать... Я ненавижу своего брата, он старше меня на 10 лет. И всё началось когда мне было 11 лет. Он стал сильно ревновать маму ко мне, хотя всю жизнь относился к ней ужасно (мы живём без отца) даже когда я была грудничком, у мамы получалось уделять сыну много внимания, тем более в его подростковый период, и дальше тоже. Она работала для нас очень много и всё же без её тепла мы не оставались. Он всегда рос эгоистом, в этом очень похож на отца, материл маму просто так, когда она учила его правильным поступкам он грубил ей, бил, выворачивал руки, шлялся до поздна и не подходил к телефону, и случаи с алкоголем нам надоели, она столько ночей не спала из за него. Я пыталась её защищать, но сил не хватало. Он стал терроризировать меня, другого слова не подобрать, вечно выдумывал истории про меня и мальчиков, был даже вопиющий случай, заявился и говорит ""рядом с домом запах мужских духов, это ты шлялась с кем то"", что было дальше без слез не вспомнить, я была совсем ребёнком, в те дни грипповала, с постели встать не могла, а мама рядом носилась, ухаживала. Но он ничего не слушал. Побои, оскорбления, унижения, скандалы это всё, что я помню с детства, мама меня воспитывала строго, и единственное что я любила это учёба и спорт. Он контролировал даже когда я спала. К слову я всегда трепетно относилась к родственным связям. Но со временем во мне что то переломилось, прибавилось сил и смелости, ума и дерзости. Я поняла, что могу ставить его на место, потому что его несправедливое отношение порядком надоело. Больше всего мне было жаль маму... У неё действительно была очень сложная жизнь. Мы чуть было не остались на улице, но благодаря её мужеству у нас есть крыша над головой. Словами не описать как я ею горжусь и как я благодарна ей. Но ему мои перемены пришлись не по душе, я ведь стала поступать с ним ТОЧНО так же как и он с мамой. Именно с мамой, всё плохое, что он делал мне  я отодвинула на второй план, вплодь до запятой я говорила с ним так как он с мамой. Но он человек который никогда не признаёт свою вину, нииииикоооооогдааааа. Он ни разу не извинился перед матерью. Он стал её упрекать мол почему я выросла такой ""невоспитанной"", я могу его обматерить, ударить и т.д. я сто раз говорила, что в моих действиях он может увидеть самого себя. У нас не такой район где на улице мат на мате. Этому я научилась от него и использую исключительно против него. А ему не нравится. Единственное, что я хотела от него - хорошее отношение к маме. Всех проблем не описать..... Но жить я так больше не могу. Я понимаю, что будет с мамой, но так и хочется в петлю, я написала крошечную часть своей жизни. Сейчас мне 19, я неуравновешенная психопатка, он сделал из меня истеричку, у меня нет парня, нет подруг (не выпускает из дома) с трудом получила получила только средней специальное образование, а работы нет, всё по той же причине, всё через скандал. Живём впроголодь, одежду с мамой носим одну на двоих. Единицы время от времени получается кинуть чтоб в интернет выйти. Интернет стал моей норкой, я могу в ней спрятаться и поговорить с людьми которые действительно меня понимают. Но даже выход в интернет для меня нелёгкое дело. Я так хочу умереть. Почти каждый день нервы нервы нервы. Всю жизнь окружающих меня людей успокаивала... я выдахлась. У меня столько комплексов появилось. Проблемы были всегда в школе унижали из за бедности, в колледже тоже, но больше всего заботит дом. Нет денег, чтоб не много поменять свою жизнь, живём за 35 км от города а за 2017 год я там ни разу не была, нет средств. Я могу уйти из дома, но денег ни гроша, идти не к кому. Я повзрослел раньше положенного... Я устала. Я сдаюсь ",

As a result, everyone concludes that I am callous and rude and in general I do not care. I myself speak very little and do not ""let"" new acquaintances come to me, I cannot have a casual conversation.

I asked N what was happening to L, if everything was all right with his head. And he just ""merged"" all these dialogues and L only got more pleasure from my suffering. Less than a week left until the end of school and they decided to make my life hell. L constantly writes to me, says that I am worthless, mama's son, I can’t do anything myself, that I will never have a relationship, he spoke about my figure. The same thing is repeated in public at school. I asked my father for help, from whom he always took an example, he says that you just need to fill your face, and the only thing that I did not inherit from my parents is my love for sports, martial arts (my father had a black belt, grandfather was a city champion in judo).

1,"At the moment I am 12 years old, you ask what problems can arise at such a young age?",
1,"I've reached the limit. For the last 3 years my life has been going downhill. Last year we managed to level the situation a little, but now there is a big recession again. I have the most difficult age, when I already need to have some achievements, but they simply do not exist. Given my interests and level of intelligence, this is simply unforgivable. To begin with, this has been going on since childhood. From the age of 13 I lost my friends and they were gone for 10 years. Most of all in my childhood I was afraid of loneliness, but in the end I got it in full. At some point in time, the hope for a miracle dawned. From about 20 to 27 years old, my life was striped - ups and downs. For about 25 years I was thinking of leaving this life, since there was no relationship with girls. Then a former friend pulled me out of the swamp. Literally a couple of months later, I met a girl and we lived with her for a month, and after that we parted, being completely different. In the same 2011, a lot of good things happened: I made a lot of good friends, life was in full swing, there was more than enough energy. In 2012, I began to earn more or less normally, and at the beginning of 2013 I left my parents and met a good girl. Life went uphill. I was the happiest person on Earth. But the happiness was extremely short-lived. In the summer of that year, I lost everyone. In May, he had a row with his brother and stopped communicating with him. In May-June, I stopped communicating with my two best friends due to the fact that they drank a lot and thus pulled to the bottom. And in July the girl left (I rented a room and there were no prospects). Surprisingly, I was not upset and during the fall of 2013 I read a lot, walked, engaged in self-development, but the oppressive feeling of loneliness led to a dead end on the New Year holidays and I decided to fix everything. But my methods led to the fact that during these three years I could not solve either financial difficulties or improve my personal life. All is in vain. As if some kind of bad karma had formed. As a result, routine, loneliness, impotence, alienation. Parents are no longer young and do not believe in me. I live now far from them, but it did not work out here either.

There is a job that I feel bad at, there is a house in which I am always alone, there are relatives who are not with me. There was love in my life, and more than once, but none of them loved me, and sometimes they hurt so unbearably that I never recovered. And someone loved me, but I didn't. It never coincided, even funny somehow ... It didn't work out with friends either, maybe because I'm used to being alone and not used to impose my society. And there is really no one to be friends with, I don't go anywhere, I don't go to visit. I understand that it is most likely in myself, but what can I do with myself? This is how my life turned out ... At the age of 14 I was raped, after that I begged my parents to take me to another city to my distant relatives and leave me there, away from my native places. Before leaving school, I lived with not too loving relatives, then left them , studied, returned home a few years later. But I couldn't stay there for a long time, I left for another city, and since then I live alone. My whole life is that I go to work and come home. Everyone tells me that if I wanted to, I could get married, at least give birth to a child, but I just can't, I can't imagine how it is - just to get married ... At some point I felt that I was slowly fading away and tried to break out of her swamp, change her life. I took a vacation without pay, went to Moscow to see my sister, hoped to get a job, suddenly everything would turn out differently ... But nothing works for me, I am not hired, my resume is of no interest to anyone, and, apparently, my age is already uninteresting for employers. And I can't work in a supermarket, because my legs hurt, my joints are problematic ... My only joy at the moment is my little one-year-old nephew, whom I love with all my heart and next to whom I feel so good ... But if I have nothing it will work out with work in Moscow, I will have to return to my city, return to work and start living again away from my beloved baby, that monotonous life that I hate so much and which still does not end ... I understand that it is a sin to complain that we must be grateful to God for what you have, that there are people who are incomparably worse than me. But I don't need this empty life, there is only a bleak old age and even greater loneliness ahead. It feels like I'm taking someone's place in life, someone who could take advantage of all the joys of life ... How to come to terms with this life, how to accustom yourself to the thought of patience, that you have to wait and someday that's all will finally end? I never think about suicide, I just really look forward to the natural end ... Why is it so long, why does life never end? ...",
1,"I was married, I was happy, my husband and I loved each other very much. Although there were many contradictions and conflicts. The husband was caring and affectionate, we got along well, but often at the time of a quarrel, he talked about parting. As if a person was being replaced, he suddenly became so fit and offended me. It upset me a lot. I was angry with him, took offense, and then cried and asked not to leave. And again we were madly in love with each other. Now I understand that I needed all these emotions. Then our baby was born, and I found out that my husband's father and brother are sick with manic-depressive syndrome. Because of this, at one time, my mother-in-law divorced her husband's father, and they do not communicate with her brother either. I screwed myself up, worried about the child. Our relationship with my husband got worse. He wanted a second child, I also wanted, but could not decide to give birth, because the disease is hereditary. Then I found love correspondence with my husband, he explained that he had little attention from me, and that the girl was very tender with him. I forgave and promised to be more attentive to him. I wrote to this girl so that she would no longer bother my husband. The husband agreed, although he was a little upset. Then again correspondence with another girl. But it was all just correspondence on the Internet. And I forgave again. My husband told me that it was my fault. And again I tried to correct myself, became more tender, began to try harder at home. I really felt guilty, because because of the news of the illness of my husband's relatives, I was somewhat withdrawn into myself, my worries. And after the reconciliation, we again bathed in love. And then quarrels began again, and I found another correspondence. And my husband said that it was impossible to live with me, and left. Now he is with this woman, she has two children from her first marriage. And she is pregnant by my husband. On social networks, she constantly writes declarations of love to him, and how happy she is, and that they have true love, and exposes their joint photos with her children. It's been 3 years already, I also got married. My husband takes care of us, very economic, everything is in the house. It would be difficult for me without him. And never once in a quarrel did he talk about parting, he always says: you are my family, and I will never leave you. But he is not at all like my ex-husband. We had love with our ex, we could talk for hours, we always slept in an embrace, walked a lot together, went on trips, spent the night in a tent, played games, invited friends to our place. And my current husband considers walking as a waste of time, sleeping in an embrace is not comfortable for him, camping is not his at all - he needs comfort. And love for him is rather a habit, a responsibility. He works a lot, and on weekends too, I am all the time alone with the children (I gave birth to a second from him). And I really miss my ex, I love him, and I want to be with him. But this is impossible. I scold myself that I did not give birth to a second one, I cheated myself about this disease, and maybe it would not have passed on to the children. But I would be happy with my beloved husband. And now it's just gray everyday life, I live only for the sake of children, and I understand that such love in my life will no longer be, and without love I cannot. I can't see the ex, he comes to take the child, and all the time with the children of that woman. I'm cold with me. I don’t know how to live on. I want to die.",

With her, I was calmer with her, all the problems in my life were forgotten.

I want to end my life, but I catch myself thinking that if I kill myself, nothing will change. I don't believe in God, so I think that after death there is nothing, empty. It makes it even worse. I think that our brain is responsible for everything in our life. All emotions, all experiences and feelings, this is all the chemistry of our brain. And from this, too, it only gets worse every day. At the moment I want only one thing, it is to find a girl in love with whom to hug her to kiss. But I don’t do it, because I know that she will not care.

At one time I tried with all my might to develop (for about 4 years I did not give up) and signed up for English courses, I tried to read (it was very difficult for me to do it even through force, but after a while I still forgot everything), but everything remained the same. Since childhood, I have a very hard time understanding. What comes to ordinary people the first time, it will reach me only from the third or not at all. At school I was always humiliated about this and called stupid. I could take with charisma or enthusiasm, but in this regard I am also worse than other people. I have no friends at all. Believe me, I also tried many times To look for them and it all comes down to the fact that people are just bored with me. At first they value me as a good listener (because I am insincerely interested, ask questions and supposedly listen), and then people get bored with me, because communication cannot be only in one st And I can't say that these are not my people, since I tried to get to know a lot and with different people, and the outcome is always the same. Yes, even with myself it’s boring - mostly I just lie looking at the ceiling, eat, sometimes I listen music and think as if to fall asleep as soon as possible so that at least a little bit to fall out of this gray reality. In communication, I simply have nothing to tell other people. There is no sense of humor and some kind of fire either (for example, in the courses, everyone tells how they spent time, jokes , and they consider me to be weird, because I’m not joking and I never tell anything (again, even if I wanted to, there’s nothing), basically the teacher just comes up with sentences for me, and I translate them). I’m not a beauty far away (I don’t embellish it). And I’ll say right away that I’m not an introvert - if I had my way, I would go to clubs, karaoke and public places, but I have no one with anyone and I consider it low-grade entertainment (I always tried this eradicate in myself, strives to be smarter and who I am not). There is dancing and make-up, but I think these interests are very primitive. It's a shame that there are funny, there are smart, there are beautiful, there is even everything together, but I just don't. I don't know how and what to live for. I don't know what to do.

1,"Не знаю, зачем пишу это здесь. Попал в тупиковую ситуацию. Я из неполной семьи. Когда мне было 8 лет, из семьи ушёл отец. Я воспитывался мамой и бабушкой.  Перестройка, потом развал союза, моё детство было непростым. Семья сильно нуждалась. Мама получала пенсию по инвалидности. Отец почти не помогал, присылал только алименты, положенные по закону. На это и жили. Особенно обострилась ситуация в начале 90-ых. Мне, как подростку, хотелось каких то вещей, которые были у друзей. В 18 лет вместо учебы стал работать, но заработок меня не устраивал. Уехал из родного города в Москву. Устроился на работу. Стал учиться.  Через год с несколькими коллегами организовали своё дело. Мне было 23 года. Сначала купи-продай. Затем, в конце нулевых, открыли небольшое производство. Это был мой счастливый лотерейный билет. В сфере к тому времени был дефицит предложения. На заказы к нам была очередь. Мы просто оказались в нужном месте в нужное время. Но мне тогда казалось что это я охренительный бизнесмен, все продумал, и просто молодец. Настало время обустраивать личную жизнь. Купил дорогую машину, вместо жилья, снял дорогую квартиру, вместо ипотеки, которую в то время мог легко отбить досрочно. тряпки,клубы, кабаки, дорогие увлечения, частые поездки заграницу. Мне просто сорвало башню от денег, которых до этого момента никогда не имел. Подруг было много,но Избранница никак не находилась, но я не переживал по этому поводу, думал что просто плохо ищу, и шлялся по злачным местам ещё больше. К тому времени мы расширили производство, дела шли, и мне казалось, что так будет всегда, и ниже этого уровня я никогда не опущусь. Наконец я встретил девушку, совсем не там, где искал. Случайно. Это был мой второй лотерейный билет. Сначала Бог дал мне достаток, затем очень нужного и правильного человека. Но на тот момент мне так не казалось. Я считал её не гламурной, и просто какой-то "" не такой"". И параллельно вёл поиски дальше. Хотя активность поисков сильно снизилась. Спустя 2 года мне хватило ума, слава богу, на ней жениться. К этому времени активность на строительном рынке снизилась. Содержать большое производство на арендованной площади стало трудно, а потом и просто невозможно. У нас родился ребёнок, и через полгода после этого радостного события контора моя сдулась. После 14 лет существования. 14 лет я жил только этим. И крах. Сказать, что это было шоком, это не сказать ничего. Я не знал что мне делать, куда мне идти. Приятель уговорил на остатки средств вложиться в другой бизнес, в сфере общепита, в котором я ничего не понимал. Я согласился, что называется, на автомате. Год я этим занимаюсь. Состояние дел находится на грани рентабельности. Часто не хватает даже на съемное жильё. На развитие нужны средства, которых нет да и наличие их не даст 100 процентов гарантии успеха. Жена с дочкой живёт у своих родителей в другом городе,т к я нев состоянии их кормить. Моя работа занимает у меня 12-15 часов в сутки, состоит из постоянных напрягов, скандалов с арендодателями, и прочих приятных вещей. К семье езжу раз в 2 недели, на день. Нервная система расшатана до такой степени, что я живу в постоянном ожидании беды. Как будто в любой момент что -то должно произойти. На данный момент мои проблемы исключительно материальные. Я понимаю это, но легче не становится. Я не могу бросить бизнес, потому что вложил в него все что есть. Но и жить дальше так не могу, потому что денег нет ни на что. Вариант подработки тоже отсутствует , т к на него просто нет времени. Мне почти 40, у меня было все, и я это все потерял. Сейчас у меня есть только непонятная работа, которая высасывает из меня все соки и ничего не даёт взамен. И семья, которую я очень люблю, но совсем не вижу и которой не могу ничего дать.  И очень боюсь потерять, т к сколько будет терпеть жена этот бардак в моей жизни, не знаю. Я конечно далёк от суицида. Но иногда стал думать об этом. Вернее о том, что движет людьми, которые это делают. И это меня тоже пугает. Всё очень напоминает замкнутый круг. Не с кем даже поговорить. Жена загнанная, она одна тянет ребёнка. Друзья удивительным образом исчезли с появлением материальных проблем. Буду рад любому совету. Спасибо",

After all, they are 50 years old. They will probably suffer a lot when I die. My family is not very prosperous. The father drinks, the mother is at work (she lives there in the hostel), she comes home a couple of times a week. I'm in my 1st year of college now, and I'm a bad student, probably because I'm dumb. I have very low self-esteem, it always seems to me that I am a freak, and not like everyone else. If I fail my exams, I'm going to die. I'm very lazy, I'm too lazy to prepare for exams, and I don't know where to start. I've never had a girlfriend, I think it's understandable for what reasons. I'm tired of everything, of the whole world, of people. I have no friends, so I sit at the computer for days, only on the Internet I have a couple of friends. But they are far, far away. Most likely we will never see each other, although, maybe in hell. Although I'm not sure if Hell exists, I thought there was a complete void.",

I was a very cheerful person with the soul of the company, a hardworking person, but now it's not about me. All advice such as physical activity, communication with people, new acquaintances, contacting specialists, overloading yourself with work, etc. does not help at all, only time and money wasted in vain as it was bad and remained. what other options are there",

When I come into the room with my parents, they always swear, and if I come into the living room, they also kick me out far away, but not into the house. I want a normal life, but I will never have it. I am superfluous in this life, but for a long time did not admit it. And I ask you to help me avoid this. How to do it?",

Stop being silly and see how good it is."" Now, I'm mutilating my body because I'm bored. At the moment, I also have a bad relationship with my mother and all the rest of the family. And in a day I think to end my life more than quitting smoking, and what else can I stay when my existence brings joy only to me?",

My mother often screams at me, often insults me even if I have not done anything. On this basis, I began to think about suicide. I have friends, but in a difficult moment when I expect support from them, they simply turn away from me, they need me only for their benefit. I'm tired of crying every day. I used to think about death after being yelled at, but now I think about death even if everything is fine, I just understand that it cannot go on for so long. I just bother them",
1,"Suicide seems rational. More and more I want to start looking closely for an apology for suicide. Previously, it was only on an emotional level. Stress, depression. Pain that no longer fits inside. I became like a bare nerve, touching which causes nothing but hellish agony. Then fear increased. Fear to live. To do something, to go somewhere. I am not calm, locked in four walls, I shiver when I have to go outside. Life does not seem to be something unique. This is chaos, an accident that has arisen, which does not have a purpose, a plan. My rationality begins to adjust to emotions, because it is unable to control them. It logically leads to the conclusion that there is no way. It doesn't matter if you die now or later, it only determines the amount of anguish and pain you will have to experience. And although my suffering is euphemeral, and incomparable with the actual hardships of life, they do not let me go. The mind is struggling to come up with something, somehow solve it, because emotions overshadow it, envelop it in darkness and emptiness. I am cut off from everything, everything seems surreal. There is only fear, anger, despair. And it distorts me, the world, everything around.",

1,". I have such a problem: I am a student in the seventh grade and I have a geometry test for test 2. Mom didn’t really scold me, I said that I would fix it. But then she looked at the electronic diary and there I had 3 in social studies (I’ll say right away, this is the only three) and three in biology (which I don’t understand, although I’m trying to teach). Immediately, my mother's roof fell. For her, three = two. She started yelling at me like look at your grades, who are you going to work. And in general, I'm a stupid chicken, a fool, why gave birth to me, etc. It came down to geometry. I study with a tutor and here are 2 for the test. But the problem is that the test was on Thursday, and the tutor on Monday and Friday. And how can you explain this to her !? After she hit me on the back, it didn't hurt very much, but it was wildly insulting. I cried almost all night, and the next day after school, when I came home, my dad also ran over. He also shouted at me, called me names, etc. I cried again, and he left. And I really wanted to commit suicide. I was very close to suicide. But I still don't want to live, they got it already. Mom and Dad are ignored, I can't get in touch with my grandmother, there is no one with whom I can share and just cry. Help, please, what should I do?",

Plus constant quarrels with my stepmother and her child. I can't stand it. I was at a psychiatrist and a psychologist. The results were bad. Depression, apathy, schizoid. All this pulls me to suicide. No friends. No support. Everyone turned away from me. Not I understand why. I am very surprised at everything that happens to me in my 15.",
1,"I can't do this anymore. They constantly have thoughts of suicide to end it all. The only thing that holds back is the thought that the parents cannot bear it. I study at the medical university in the 4th year and every damn weekday I go to the university I hate. I used to want to be a doctor, now I am completely disappointed in the profession and I understand that I will never become one, that all 4 years of hellish work were in vain, and there are 2 more of the same ahead. Studying was hard before, but now it's hard to just force yourself to do something. I study at 4-5, but lately it has become terribly disgusting from all this. The word ""study"" became for me like a rattle on glass. I regret the lost time, but I am 100% aware that this is my and only my mistake, and the state in which I find myself is the payback for this mistake. It's scary that I can't find myself in life. Friends, real friends, no at all. I have repeatedly tried to share the problem with my parents, but they do not understand me, they do not even take seriously my conversations about not wanting to be a doctor. There can be no question of leaving the university. ""Well, where are you without a diploma?""",
1,"The thing is, I'm a trance. Yes. I am not aware of myself either as a woman or as a man. I just am. Mother and father divorced when I was 7 years old. I always humiliated myself, as did my mother, when I did something wrong. This is terrible. Once, the boys beat me up and my mother stood up for them, saying ""You can't tell the boys that since they beat you, they acted like girls! It humiliates them."" Yes, I do not care what happened to them! Everything hurts terribly, but especially the soul. Everyone says I'm greyhound, weird, stupid, pathetic and hated. There are compliments, but they have no effect. I was brought up like ""It couldn't be worse than you!"" And I want to protect myself. And now I try to look like a boy. And I'm lucky. I am really sometimes mistaken for a boy and do not offend. The chest does not grow, because of this they were insulted, but when I said that it was a boy, the ridicule stopped. It's so easy for me now. I have a little schizophrenia. Split personality. There are many other people in me and they command me in turn. There are many problems because of them. One person does not remember what the other did. And they tease me. Although less often. I cry all the time and don't want to live. It is so painful. And they say ""You are just a show-off"", but they write themselves in VK ""We are crazy, it's so fun, ha-ha"", ""We were found by a psychiatric hospital, we are saved, lol!"" BUT IT'S NOT FUN !!!",

1,"! I am 17 years old and I am finishing 11th grade. I am very scared, because exams are coming soon, and my parents expect only the best results from me (but something can always go wrong). I am very shy and it is very difficult to get me to talk. Recently, I have completely stopped trusting people. My grandmother and mother often quarrel, and I can't look at how bad they are. Grandma had cancer and she shouldn't worry. When I try to get her to go to the hospital, she tries in every way to change the subject. I understand that she sacrifices her health for the sake of my studies (she left after 9 for the city). And I can't offer her anything in return. I'm just useless. There is no one next to me: no friends, not parents. Sometimes, to calm myself, I talk to fictional parents (my dad left when I was a week old) and imagine how they would love me. Mom is a separate story: after dad left, she could not find anyone, she began to pray, and now she advises to turn to God for all my problems.",
1,"My story began with the death of my most beloved friend ... I don't know, I don't understand whether I loved him or not, but I know for sure that he was a very dear person to me. My friend always took care of me, he always smiled. In the summer of 2015, he was gone, he acted like a hero, he saved a boy who almost died, he saved his life, he was gone. On the same day I did not find out about it, I found out a week later, my parents and his relatives did not tell me. They were afraid that I would do something to myself, then I just thought that I regret not being with him longer. This is not the only reason I am. In the winter of 2016, another revolution took place in my life. I was not the only child, I was the eldest daughter. The key word was, my little sister got sick, I do not blame myself or my father who infected me, I was on the brink of death myself, but I survived, but my sister was not so strong, she was always weak. She had cerebral palsy. I didn't think that she was different from other children. No, I loved her, she was my everything. My sister died from illness when there were 2 days left before her birthday. I didn’t forgive myself for this, every day since that day I blamed myself, I blame myself to this day, if I hadn’t got sick then, wouldn’t have infected her, then would it have been different? Is it all my fault? Every day I wake up with the thought that I am terrible, with the thought, am I this is all my fault? How can I deal with this, I want my friend and my sister to be proud of me, but I can't. I am gnawed at the thought that I will never be able to tell them that this is what life is, I can't seem like the immunity that I love. I don't look my dad and mom in the eye. I love them, but I know they hate me, secretly, deep down, is it all my fault?",

Nothing makes me happy anymore, I have apathy and just one thought - to leave me alone! I don't know how to get rid of suicidal thoughts. Sometimes it seems that death is a way out of all these problems that are constantly will be with me.",
1,"Yes, I tried to commit suicide, but I didn't have the heart. Then 13 years ago, the future seemed to me smeared only with black colors. I felt insecure in myself, in my abilities, and my father only added fuel to the fire, saying that with my disgusting character, nothing would work out in my life. Oddly enough, something worked out: I graduated from college, I live in my own apartment, I have a job. I'm lonely, terribly lonely. In all my life I have never had friends, I have no one to communicate with. For a disgusting character, a couple of years ago they were fired from work under the article. I somehow corrected the work book through the court, but the sediment remained. In my spare time I write to my former employer slander. So far I got away with it, but today from the prosecutor's office they brought me a presentation. I work in a small organization that no one cares about, so I immediately determined that this very person who almost ruined my work book, so it means, decided to try to ruin my life again. Apparently he doesn't like me. And why does fate hate me so? My parents haven't come to see me for a long time. The elder brother was working somewhere nearby, but he never looked at me. Everybody left me. At work, in addition, today the chief accountant suddenly began to demand some kind of paperwork and tomorrow promised to report my non-performance to the management, and I have a bunch of cases, reports, controls that I barely have time to complete, and then there is a representation from the prosecutor's office. I went home like a dead man. I kept thinking, why then 13 years ago, when I tried to commit suicide, I did not have enough strength? Now this would not be all! I am 33 years old, but I do not know how to communicate and I have never had a girlfriend. My classmates have a bunch of kids, and I have no idea how to make an acquaintance.

I understand that she herself does not understand what she is talking about ... But I feel worse. Tomorrow I'll go to school again, or maybe not. I was looking for ways to kill myself.

1,", I'm a dumb suicide. The stories on this site are quite dramatic and compassionate, but my story lacks any drama. The fact is that I come from a good family, there were no problems with my studies and from a financial point of view I was not somehow deprived. After school, having entered a good, maybe even the best, university, I did not last even a year there. He himself could not explain the reason for himself: he simply stopped appearing there and lied to everyone that I was studying and everything was fine. Soon, all the same, I had to pick up the documents and inform the parents. He said that he did not want to go to this university anymore and, in order not to upset them, immediately entered another and lived separately. The scholarship and money that my parents sent me was enough. I finished the semester with an almost honors student. But later I was again covered with something and I again “just stopped showing up at the university,” during which time I left the room only to the store and did not want to talk to anyone. I spoke with my parents and loved ones less and less, and then completely ignored all calls and messages. I thought that I would move away from them and they would even get used to the fact that I was not and would not be severely traumatized psychologically. And I seemed to have thought of everything and was ready, but one person was there all the time, not physically and no matter how I pushed him away, I feel warm and I'm afraid to hurt him badly. And also the parents' birthday is coming soon - they will probably feel bad from such a “gift”. But I have been voluntarily alienated from society for so long and everything seems insoluble, and even if I change my mind, it will only get worse. And I see no other way out. And I don’t want to see. It is easier for me to isolate myself from everyone and quietly disappear than to open up, overcome my fears, try, change, please everyone and not disappoint. I hate myself so much, I am sorry that I am in the lives of these people, I am sorry that I hurt them. If I stay, I will cause a lot more problems. If I leave for good, then this pile will get better on them immediately and pass in a few or many years.",

1,". Please help me, I am very confused and I cannot get out of this. I'll start from the very beginning. I think it all started in 2014, when my family was forced to move to another city. It hit me very hard, as I was a quiet child and it was very difficult to get used to something new. And here is a new city, a new school, new people. I was very worried about this. It was around this time that I had my first panic attack. At the new school, I lagged behind in subjects and could not find a common language with my classmates, in the end I was absolutely alone. A year later, I lost the person closest to me, after that I did not want to live at all, but something continued to keep me in this world. In the 11th grade, I again went to a new school, but I could not find friends there either. Despite my condition, I was still able to successfully pass the exams and enter the university. I even found friends, although it seems to me that they are not very interested in communicating with me, and I am more of a backup option. I started to get distracted a little, and everything seemed to be fine until a certain time. Anxiety and obsessive thoughts, including suicidal ones, began to visit me again. The feeling of guilt before the deceased relative has increased. My favorite activities no longer bring any joy, I carry out my study tasks through strength. I do not want to communicate with someone, this is most likely because I do not know how to talk to people. Constantly some kind of sleepiness and fatigue, apathy and unwillingness to do anything. Sometimes even just washing it can be difficult. But deep down, despite the constant thoughts of suicide, I would like to change myself, my life, become kinder and more sociable, but no matter how hard I try, nothing works out for me, I always return to where I started. I feel very bad.",

I felt very bad, it eventually came to a hysteria with self-flagellation, and he could not bear it. He said that nothing more, never, in any way, said that he lied to me everything.

But after one of these times and after he said that “well, I once loved, now I don’t love”, then he said that he was sick when I had to take my things (it took me another month that he was not sick , just said this so as not to help more, not to mess with me in any way). And I got angry at him, for all his irresponsibility and behavior, at his mother, who wrote that I was “a reflection of his bad sides”, at everything, at everything, at everyone.

We met at a cousin’s sister. We saw each other mostly on weekends, because we live in different cities. After 2 months we parted on his initiative, because there were many quarrels over trifles. This time seemed like hell, I fell in love with this person with all my heart, before that I was alone for 3 years, after the divorce. We did not communicate for four months, then he showed up, decided to start all over again. Everything was fine, they made plans for the future, got to know him with her daughter, they seemed to get along. We planned that we would move to him. He was always very attentive, constantly wrote and called. The other day I accidentally found out that he was texting and was going to meet another girl, I found out through his friend. I decided to talk to him. He said it was a lie, he was not going to meet with her, she herself suggested. Of course, this does not change the difference. I asked why he didn’t tell me anything, they would disperse and meet with whoever he wanted, without offending anyone. He replied that a friend told him that he was going to tell me about it, didn’t see any reason for me to talk about it again, because it’s probably bad for me. Generally shifted the responsibility to a friend. He says that I am a stranger to him, there are no feelings that were in the previous relationship, so he sees no point in being with me. I think I would forgive him everything ... I feel so bad. I understand that you need to be strong for the sake of a child, this man is not worth it, but his hands dropped.

I constantly tried to distract myself and become normal, but I constantly burned out, and again fell to the very bottom, barely climbing. At one time I started programming as a hobby, read a ton of books, got very carried away with this business, I really liked it, I advanced so much that I helped students do term papers and theses, wrote some utilities and games. Then I lost interest in this, the thought that I was doing something unnecessary and not interesting to anyone pressed on me. I decided to go in for sports, bought a bike and the first year I just enjoyed myself, maybe even I was happy to go out of town to ride in the woods with music. The next season, cycling ceased to bring me joy, but on the contrary, it began to depress me. Then I began to go hiking with a group of tourists, and in the same way at first I got lost in it, I thought that I had found what I want from life - mountains, caves, taiga, rivers, sea.

All the time I assured myself that I would not act as I did earlier, namely, to endure the brain, reproach and so on. It seemed that the action had just begun as I again began to behave the same way as before with him. I constantly promise that I will not be like this anymore, but it’s not the same. I was sure that I had changed, especially after so much suffering. He told me himself that nothing had changed. I kind of tried to improve relations with him every time, but in the end it only made things worse. And as a result, while he was under strong influence, I behaved terribly, that is, I took out my brain again, it came to insults on my part, because I was jealous of him. Then he threw me on the black list, I went to him to do something fix, he said that we would not be together. Then I began to humiliate myself in front of him, I ran after him, he scared me and said go home, but I didn’t, I ran after him so that I would give him a chance again and again. As a result, now he does not want to see me, hear or communicate, as he said that his opinion about me had changed for the worse because of my behavior.

Мы не могли гулять втроем, так как для нее я был врагом,это ж я ушел от нее, не сумев забыть бывшую.. мы стали заметно реже общаться с другом, мне не давало это покоя, потом, я уехал работать на вахту до осени, обиженый и одинокий.он не особо шел на контакт, не звонил не писал. Еще, лет с 17 он всегда должен мне деньги, занимал охотно, а вот отдавал не особо, меня всегда это обижало, ведь этим он показывал свое отношение ко мне, я чувствовал себя делом десятым в его жизни. Но я всегда закрывал глаза на это, прощал, друг де, занимал еще. Он и по сей день мне должен. Его долг никогда не был на отметке 0. Я вернулся в город, сейчас уже не помню, точного развития событий. Но мы продолжили общаться, пусть и реже, из за его на тот момент уже девушки. Со временем, мы с ней помирились, общались, она часто звонила мне, рассказывала какой он мудак, искала его, а я его прикрывал. Зная где он, не выдавал, и т.п. на сл год я вновь уехал, в середине вахты он сообщил мне, что он жениться на ней, что у них будет ребенок. Брак по залету. Я был свидетелем на свадьбе. На свадьбу я не знал что подарить и написал в конверте, что прощаю ему долг, кажется в 12к, в день свадьбы, когда мы поехали за реквизитами, он оставил кошелек дома,и попросил занять ему до конца свадьбы денег, мол родственники подарят же, он и вернет, у меня была только бумажка в 5к, я дал ее, а он в очередной раз не выполнил обещание. Шли  дни месяца, мне все так же звонила уже его жена, в слезах, жаловалась, он был плохим, плохо относился к ней, мог спокойно не ночевать дома или прийти пьяным или обкуреным, летом 2016 даже уже осенью, мы все чаще начали общаться с его женой, у нас был общий человек, который мало во что нас ставил, все чаще она рыдала, рассказывая как он некрасиво себя ведет, уходит в магаз за продуктами и возвращается через кучу часов и не всегда с продуктами и много подобных ситуаций.в последний месяц осени,мне надоело, что она всегда плачет, я чувствовал в этом и свою вину, так как это я пару лет назад ""отдал ее ему"" и обрек на страдания, я предложил ей съехать, стал оплачивать ей жилье, помогал деньгами. И мы настолько с ней сблизились, что стали смотреть друг на друга влюбленными глазами, мы переспали. На тот момент, он уже стал в моих глазах очень плохим человеком, я столько грязи выслушивал про него, что не удивительно. В общем нас с его женой, сплотил он сам, так как делал нам обоим больно. Шли месяца, мы спали, общались, но меня всегда посещало желание вновь уйти от нее, ведь это жена моего друга, но она всегда не давала мне сделать этот шаг, агитируя это тем, что  она не хочет, что бы мы упускали свое счастье из за него, убеждала меня, что он это заслужил. она хотела отношений (ведь чувствовала себя рядом со мной под защитой что ли) а я, всего лишь хотел наладить ее жизнь, которую я же когда то и испортил(это мое мнение). Я не мог ей дать то, чего сам не хотел. Последние пару недель, мы с ней не общались, поссорились, расстались. И вот сегодня, мне пришло смс от него ""ах ты ***, ты нажил худшего врага"", он все узнал, не знаю как и насколько все. И сегодня я будто проснулся, осознал все, что сделал: я предал друга. Знаете, мне никогда не было так плохо как сейчас, такое ощущение, будто я умер. Я потерял не только друга, я потерял большую часть себя. Я не знаю как жить дальше. Я потерял уважение к себе, я не могу спокойно общаться даже с незнакомыми мне людьми, мне очень стыдно, мне стыдно идти по улице. Днем, я хотел умереть, но я просто представил, сколько я принесу горя своим близким, они этого не заслуживают.. где взять силы пережить всё это, такое ощущение, что я лежу на дне океана, а на меня давит куча воды. Мне очень больно. Я не хочу общаться с людьми, так как не хочу, что бы кто то общался с таким навозом как я.. я и так не особо любил сам себя, самооценка всю жизнь была занижена, а сейчас самое дно моего существования. Я думал я делаю правильное дело, помогая ей выбраться из этого хаоса, тем временем я предавал друга, сам того не осознавая. Где был мой мозг в то время я не знаю.",

1,Good day,
1,"Hey. From time to time, thoughts of suicide come. I am very tired and my parents put pressure on me. I study well, without Cs, I entered another school, but only for two profiles instead of four. Because of this, my parents swear a lot and constantly nag me. All year I tried very hard and it is very offensive when you ask for help from your relatives, and they start to persecute you even more. I heard my father telling his parents that I was useless, stupid and unmotivated; for the whole year I myself did not even ask how I was doing. Mother constantly scolds for the whole year, she did not hear a single kind word from her, and I am not exaggerating. I was really very tired this year and worked very hard, and when I hear all this I feel very bad. On the one hand, I understand that they want the best, but on the other, I don’t understand what is the problem with supporting their child?",
1,"I had a relationship with a young man, for the first time I fell in love. And he left. Then he returned. Then he left again and so on for two months. Whatever it was with me beyond words, I existed. I didn't live. Then he left. I began to eat normally, live, communicate with everyone. Everything was getting better. Later, at his brother, whom I personally never knew; the girl committed suicide. And we somehow got to know each other and began to communicate. And after we began to communicate with him, I had thoughts of suicide. I do not know why. A young man has just arrived; I learned that he made up with his ex-girlfriend who came before me. But he came first of all to me. He hugged and kissed, but the next day he said that he could not deceive and that nothing would work out for us again. Bottom line: I love him, he does not love his girlfriend and me too, I communicate with his brother; he does not know this; like my brother does not know that I communicate with him. And the realization that I can never be with either one or the other. Hopelessness is a situation that she herself, in her stupidity, did. Every damn day I think about death. I'm scared, I read about it, I think about how to do it, I already want to sell the car and close the loan so that my relatives would not pay it for me later, I already think how in a note I will explain why I did it. I don't know how to be, I'm really scared.",
1,", I need help. I used to be always a cheerful soul of the company, kind and hardworking, but I broke up with my girlfriend. it took a lot of time, 1 year. but every day it gets worse and worse. I am a pretty strong person, I have experienced a lot in my life, but this breakup finally killed me. because of the break, I was fired from my job, I sleep for 2-4 hours, I can't really eat, I can't muster my strength, it came to the point that I wanted to die. this is not a real pain that I can’t defeat with pills not with the help of specialists. it gets worse and worse, and thoughts about her are constant, I got rid of all social networks, changed my number, moved to another city and somehow accidentally went to the store and met her, as I understand it, with her husband with her. it was the finish line. I was already turned inside out, I came home and tried to commit suicide, and everyone said goodbye to life. but a friend came to check on he had the keys and found me, called an ambulance, I tearfully asked them to let me die. they locked me in a psychiatric dispensary for 2 months, but nothing helps. I want to die more and more, what should I do, I've tried everything, it doesn't work out and tried to start a relationship, I can't even kiss more than one girl. right before my eyes she ...

1,", I don't know why I am writing here, tk. I'm not used to asking anyone for help, especially psychological help. I recently turned 20, I am in my first year at university. I chose computer science, because I was attracted to this specialty for a long time, I liked programming (at least, I was firmly convinced of it), and my ambitions are connected with IT. Starting practically from the second day of my studies, I began to become disillusioned with this faculty. I hated matan, the course on computer architecture attracted me at first, but then I fell behind the program and stopped understanding anything in lectures. The only course that I relatively liked was programming, but in the end I gave up on it too (I got depressed because of the approaching exams and I was no longer interested in anything). I successfully failed the first session (3 exams out of 3), I really wanted to pass at least programming, I prepared for it all day, but my exam topic turned out to be overwhelmingly difficult. After that I was very upset, but in the end I came to my senses and everything started anew. (I will clarify that I study abroad, and our teaching methods are slightly different from Russian ones, for example, exams can be retaken any number of times). At the beginning of the second semester, I had to undergo surgery, and again I fell behind in all courses. Little by little I began to catch up, albeit with difficulty, but passed the test in mathematics (not a complete exam). As I thought, at the university I made friends, including one person to whom I began to feel sympathy, we even walked a couple of times together, but now everything has changed dramatically, he simply ignores me, and I don't know why. With my appearance, everything is fine, but sometimes I have difficulties in communication, let's say it is difficult for me to express correctly in words what I really want to say, well, I often carry nonsense, especially if I am talking to someone I like. I understand that I have a painful need for attention, but I do not know how to cope with it, so I react extremely painfully to any manifestation of ignorance towards me. All of this situation together further exacerbated my unstable condition. The summer session is coming soon, I am trying to prepare but I constantly feel that I do not have enough time, and honestly I don’t know if I will pass at least one exam. I know that many would advise me to change the faculty, but firstly, I am used to finishing what I started, and secondly, I have not the slightest idea what else could interest me. My dreams are connected with the area where I study, and if I give them up, my life will lose its meaning. Although most likely, there has been no sense for a long time. Every morning when I wake up at 5:30 am and ride the train to class, I realize that I did not imagine my student years this way. And now I just have tears in my eyes, because on the one hand, I want to pass these exams, to prove to everyone that I am worth something, on the other, I feel weak, tired, helpless and worthless. I often want to die, and I don't know how to get out of this trap in my head ..",
1,"I used to just talk about physical and mental pain. Now for me moral pain is the worst thing. The heart breaks and as if something is bursting out of the chest. There is no such person who would understand me. Even to my girlfriend, I don't talk about my feelings. It's just that everything is somehow wrong. I have all the same problems. Studying just tortured me. Previously, I studied without knowledge, now it's better. I teach every lesson and do all my homework, but nothing works! This school just torments me! Day after day I come to her to look into the eyes of idiot classmates (pardon the expression) and some teachers who despise the penalty. I walk like a gray spot.

I know I shouldn't have started dating him at all. I brought him home when all my relatives and my mother went to the mountains for 3 days. And I didn’t go, because I was a leader in a seminar at school. The guy is my classmate. He loves me. But his parents will also kill him if they find out, and if they find out everything, he will end up in prison anyway. He also wants to commit suicide. I know that my mom will just kill me, I saw what she did to my cousin when she got pregnant at 23. And I’m only 16. I am very very sad. But I swear I didn't do it. It's already the second day.

All my friends are already finishing their studies, and I have remained a nonentity. Mom constantly says that I am lazy and do not want to study. And I really wanted to! When I asked my mother to go to a psychotherapist, she refused, and now she blames me for everything. And I just needed help, and if my mother had helped then, now I would study. I am sitting at home, not working, not studying. I look awful. I got fat. I do not want to appear in society because I am ashamed. I stopped communicating with my grandmother, grandfather, older sister and all relatives because I feel guilty. Everyone looks like that with reproach. She promised that I would study and did not keep my word. All girlfriends and friends tease about studies and appearance. I'm tired. I don't see the future.

1,"Hi everyone. People please help with advice on what to do if every time fate throws in different directions how to be. I am 21 years old I have one son my husband died a year ago he was 23 years old an accident poisoned by carbon monoxide & # 128546; ate as it was. I never had a quiet life, my father left my mother, leaving us three children. Mom started drinking and found another threw us. We were not needed by anyone, despite the fact that we had a lot of uncles and aunts, they all threw us around like kittens. In the end, we were taken by an uncle from my mother’s side. But we were not interested in him most of all, he was interested in the money that the guardianship authorities paid for us. I’ll say right away my uncle’s life was terrible and unbearable. Of course, I want to tell everything, but write about it. At the age of 16 I met my husband, he saw and understood everything. He was a support for me, I always felt protected with him & # 128522; you know at that time I was happy that I had him. For 18 years I married him. his parents accepted me as their daughter, never let them run around me. A month later, I found out that the pregnant woman gave birth to a son, the husband was so happy he always wanted him to have his first son. We lived quietly and well, even but then all the worst began, I didn’t even expect such an uncle’s wife, she began to turn the mother-in-law against me, she didn’t say it’s over, but I saw her looks. Then it became unbearable to live. The mother-in-law began to kick me out. naturally interceded but still had to live separately. So many times we saw this horror and hunger and cold. The parents did not communicate. There was no help. My husband had to take us to his aunt there, we lived as a son, and he himself went to the city to earn at least a penny. It took a long time, we lived well, everything was getting better. In the evening they called me and said that my husband was in the hospital and was in the toxicology department. Then I could not come to my senses and started calling my husband, I thought this could not be a joke. But it turned out to be true. Two hours later they called and said that he was not saved and he died such a blow, I did not expect. I don’t believe it even now. Of course, I endured a lot of things, but the death of my husband I ate as a transfer began to blame myself. At that time, I did not think about anything. I thought about the fact that fate was to scoff at me, why everything is how to live on the most dear person left, he was everything to me. As a child without a father, I myself know what it is. His parents do not even want to know me at all. His mother generally blames me for everything. I cannot sleep at night; I have nightmares. I have no help from anyone. that's how I was left alone no one needed with a child in her arms what to do in such a situation help give advice there is no more strength & # 128546 ;.",

1,"I do not see the point and do not want to live, it is painful and difficult, I did not succeed either with my studies or with work, with the guy I still love we parted with, because of him I cut my hands drunkenly, all this repulses him, of course , because he has no feelings, he already said this in my eyes at the end, met for 2 years, after him the guys used me, I thought for the better, I will forget him, but no, I can’t do anything with myself, relatives say you’re bad I found someone to die for, I understand, but it’s not only about him, so I started drinking, drank to such an extent that I did not remember what she said and what she did in this state, I was ashamed that it’s better to die, my parents were ashamed of me , didn’t drink for a while, left for another city, looked for work, they just don’t take me (no experience, little etc) got drunk, my aunt sent me back home and I didn’t mind, it was a shame, and my parents all my life if something is wrong, it’s always because of me or I’m to blame for it myself, I live like this, and it hurts me from everything his acquaintances in common with the ex-boyfriend invited him to visit (to sit, have a drink), I went, of course, after learning that he would be there, I wanted to talk, but I got nervous, drank, told him that horrible again, I even got into a fight, everyone turned away from me , I came home to my mother, I don’t know who, but she knew about it, and began to talk as best you could, crawl to him again, you creature, drunkard, it just became the last point, I drank <med.preparation - ed. mod. >, and went to bed, I don't remember anything further, they told me that I was a perlo, I was lying around, hitting, they decided that these were drugs, although I don't use, they took me to drug treatment in my inadequate state, I could not say anything, they found it by analysis as the parents said ""salt"" and said there will be a trial soon. I have now come more or less myself I don’t know how, maybe my stomach was washed, my parents don’t talk to me, I’m lying in my room I feel bad after this, everything happens like in a movie, eyesight bad, I'm sick of myself , not only did I not die as I wanted, but now I am still a drug addict in their eyes and they want to put me in the center, thinking that I made it up with pills, I just want to run away and die so that no one would ""help"" me to survive ...",

1,"More than a month ago I quit my job, I thought I would quickly find a new one, but now the money ran out, but still no work. I can go not according to my specialty, but, for example, a waitress or even a cleaning lady, if only there is enough for food. I understand that thoughts of death are caused by boredom and sitting at home (and all the time, clouds and rain). 2.5 years ago, my mother died of cancer and I became an orphan. I alone moved to Moscow, found a job here, found people close in spirit, began to practice yoga, draw, write. And I felt like a very happy person, despite the difficulties. I have had adventures, travels, love experiences, passion in my life. I dreamed and made plans. Even now I am grateful that I have the opportunity to live in a beautiful place, that I have a healthy body, that I can draw. But lately I have not felt anything. I'm empty. I think of death as deliverance. This is not the first time that I want to commit suicide, but last times I was stopped by thoughts about the reaction of people around me (I thought about my neighbor who would find my body in the bathroom and I felt sorry for her). And now I have no feelings. I do not care. The world will not become impoverished without me, my friends will forget, I have no beloved man, so no one will grieve for me, and if they do, I don't care. I keep doing practice, writing about my feelings in a notebook, walking alone in the park in the morning, I keep looking for work and going to interviews and dates, but I don't feel anything. I had a bright life filled with experiences, but now I just exist, like some empty vegetable. From the outside it seems a young beautiful girl, talented, everything is fine. My friends do not react to my conversations about how lonely and badly, they think that I am joking, because I have always been a positive person and coped with so many problems. I'm not afraid to die, I'm afraid to live like this, in emptiness. I do not love anyone and no one loves me. I want to close my eyes and never open them again",

1,"I'm lost. Every day I think about death, how nice it would be if I was hit by a car or if I calmly died in my sleep without suffering. I know it’s terrible to think so, but I’ve lost control of my thoughts. Nothing holds me back, I do not feel any attachment either to my parents or to my friends. I’m not even eighteen, and I’ve already drank liters of alcohol from grief and smoked, but nothing helps. Recently, I realized that something was wrong with me when I had a hysterical and I could not control myself. As a result, I broke my computer, crippled myself, and then, like an abnormal one, lay on the floor and rolled back and forth.",

I loved him very much, but I could not leave my family. So she lived in two families. My whole life was tied to him. He died 5 days ago. Apparently I died with him. I don't want to live",
1,"My story is banal, there are many. But that doesn't make it easier for me. I am alone with two children in a debt hole. There is not anyone. No grandmothers or relatives. My own dad pays alimony 675 rubles. I have huge debts. They are not employed anywhere with a normal salary, because are afraid of sick leave with children. There is no physical opportunity to work two or three jobs, because there is no one to leave children with. At the last job, they cheated and did not pay, so they also lost their work book. And I have more than 20 years of experience, it takes a lot of money for traveling to restore labor with all the records. Now she is forced to send her children to an orphanage. Since they are half-starved at home. My children have never lived outside the home, both are domestic. I am tired and every minute I wait for the electricity to be cut off or the bailiffs come for rent debts. I'm tired of being afraid. It seems to me that if I die, my boys will not lose anything, because I am not able to give them something. I am ashamed to look into their eyes. I am completely disappointed in myself. The ex-husband, instead of helping, only scoffs, and says that it is right for me, for having kicked him out, but that he mocked me and the children. He said: ""die, since you kicked me out."" In general, there is no more strength. A social organization and a charitable foundation even require a lot of inquiries, which in order to raise money for travel and a lot of time. And the children are already hungry and naked. We are very poor. Time is precious to me to find a job. They just don't take me anywhere. Things are not going my way. I see no way out. And there is no place to wait for help, but the account goes on for days. My children and I disappear. For what they suffer, I do not know. I hate and curse myself every day.

1,"Всем привет. Мне 14 лет и я очень одинока. Сейчас вспоминаю, понимаю и плачу.. я же всегда была одной! До 5 лет терпела скандалы родителей, смотрела, как папа бьет маму и тому подобное. В садике всегда сидела одна, когда все там спали, я - плакала. А мама работала там нянькой и ей вечно поступали жалобы насчет того, что я вечно плачу. Только один раз разговорилась с одной девочкой из другой группы и не заметила, как моя уже ушла в садик. И в итоге я сидела на улице и искала дорогу. Потом меня забрала бабушка к себе. Отдала в дошкольник, но и там я не нашла друзей. С тех пор меня начали окружать одни старики. Когда была маленькой, были друзья, с которыми я гуляла, но они вечно издевались надо мной и я только сейчас это до конца поняла. Один раз даже штаны перед всеми стянули...А еще я заикаюсь, они над этим тоже угорали. До 5 класса меня хоть немного окружали люди, но потом меня забрали на операцию. На позвоночник, вставили железяку на всю спину короче на всю жизнь. Ко мне пару раз пришли одноклассницы, попили чай и забили. Сейчас я на индивидуальном обучении, схожу на пару уроков и прихожу домой - лежать весь день(и всю ночь, так как ночью старики не лезут...хотя они иногда и ночью заходят) с телефоном. В интернете я могу более менее общаться. А так, за стеной у меня сидят старики и следят за каждым моим движением, скажу что-то - они сразу врываются и говорят ""С КЕМ ТЫ ПО ТЕЛЕФОНУ РАЗГОВАРИВАЕШЬ"" Бабушка никуда не отпускает, так как говорит, мол у нее на меня ответственность и если со мной что то случится - их посадят. Они даже дома меня одну не оставляют. Я сижу под замком, отбираю у них ключи, а они покупают новые и лезут, лезут. Даже конда я ранбше гуляла с недодрузьями, бабушка не отходила от окна. И сейчас, иду я со школы, а они на меня смотрят и машут рукой. А Я ТЕРПЕТЬ ИХ НЕ МОГУ, ХОЧУ УЖЕ СКОРЕЕ ИХ СМЕРТИ. Они даже к логопеду меня не водили, а только по бабкам гадалкам, которые говорили, что у меня родовое проклятие. И я в это верю. Я читала про это, твм все сходится. Вечно откладываю все на потом, живу около дома и всегда опаздываю в школу, не знаю, почему так. Я слишком высокая и полная, русская только наполовину, заикаюсь, живу с бабушкой и дедушкой которых терпеть не могу, не умею совладать со своими эмоциями, жутко ленивая и с звниженной самооценкой, КТО ЗАХОЧЕТ С ТАКОЙ ОБЩАТЬСЯ? Я бы сама с такой не за что не продолжила общение. Я испытываю отвращение к себе, у меня одежда как у какой то старой бабки. А в нормальной молодежной я себя чувствую смешной. Я даже не крашусь(хотя надо, я не смотря на свой возраст тяну на взрослую), потому что смешно выгляжу. Я хочу быть как все, иметь друзей и первую любовь, первые поцелуи и все такое, но я не могу вообще с людьми находиться. На улице я себя чувствую какой то другой, даже иногда не знаю, куда мне идти и когда(правила дорожного движения знаю, но боюсь переходить, а когда машина уже начинает ехать, я понимаю, что нужно идти и мне сигналят) Я прямо чувствую недовольные взгляды на себе. Пыталась похудеть, но я же с бабушкой живу.. она много чего покупает, а у меня стресс и я заедаю. Папа с мамой кстати развелись тогда, и сейчас иногда ко мне приезжают. На день рождение папа сказал ""это хорошо, что у тебя нет друзей, меньше проблем"" ""Сейчас все подростки бухают и курят"" А Я ХОЧУ БЫТЬ ЭТИМ ПОДРОСТКОМ. Почему они все в подростковом возрасте творили всякую херню, а я должна теперь выполнять их указания? Папа всегда говорит, чтобы я послушной была, что отдаст меня замуж за армяна, а я этих армян ненавижу точно также, как и стариков. Я даже сейчас себя глупо чувствую.. зачем я это пишу.. всем же пофиг. Извините за то, что вам пришлось это все читать.. Но у меня нет другого выхода,  мне уже надоело так жить, надоело это одиночество.. мне кажется, что это все невозможно исправить, что у меня не было ничего хорошего в жизни и я очень хочу исчезнуть. Просто чтобы все забыли про мое существование. Я хотела умереть, но мне стыдно. Особенно если я выживу, представляю реакцию бешеной бабушки и становится плохо. Даже после операции все жалели не меня, а ее, а тут такое.. Я устала от ее уставшей и недовольной морды, усьала от того, что дед ходит из комнаты в комнату сутками.. Помогите.. я ненавижу все, что меня окружает и в том числе себя... а мне нв следуюший год со всеми учиться...",

Terrible, crooked teeth. Because of this curvature, I have crooked lips and eyebrows at different levels. When I was 13, I wore braces, but everything went back to normal. I got a bad doctor, did not say that after the procedure of wearing braces, you would need to put all sorts of retrainers. And what can I say about it now?

1," everyone, my name is Katya and I am only 15 years old. I am a depressed teenager who often thinks about suicide. I have already tried to commit suicide <ed. Mod.>., But the result is one - alive. Some of my classmates said after hearing: ""Thank God,"" but I have little faith in God, I only believe in my own strength and that life on Earth has arisen differently. Thoughts about suicide have arisen since November 2016, when I stopped communicate with the boy with whom I spent my last childhood summer (the last before I go to grade 9, and then to college (I live in Tashkent, namely in Uzbekistan, that is, Central Asia, and therefore after 9th grade boys and girls should go to college or academic lyceums.) NO, he was not my boyfriend at all, we just talked like children about different things. Unfortunately, he congratulated me on my birthday (referring to the fact that then snow and we did not meet), although I congratulated him on his friend. After that I began to suffer from insomnia, because I cried a lot. Then New Year. My studies in grade 9 went smoothly and normally. Mom scolded for every joint I made, but not strongly. I met NG dryly, as if it was not a holiday, but waters, so as not to go to bed early. I spent my vacations with my grandmother. And now the longest and most difficult quarter-3 began. My parents began to scold me even more, but it was still bearable. Comes on February 11, Saturday. My parents quarreled, and then I was scolded because of the dog. Then they started asking why I was behaving this way. They asked, swore, I cried, they said that they give everything for happiness, but I was silent and roared. I always prefer to be silent. I feel that if I say something, it wakes up ridiculous, so I just keep quiet, always. Even in society I try to remain silent. But I still think everyone is crazy. It's a pity. After February 11, my phone was taken away and I was banned from using social networks. Classmates were surprised and said that a teenager does not need to be weak. Here I agreed with them, but tolerated. It's already 4 quarters, I'm tired of my mother constantly calling me names and swearing for any jamb. Recently I hit the back with a belt. I feel that I am very insignificant, very afraid of my parents and very tired of being silent. I knew that everything would lead to this since childhood, but it really hurts. And there is really no one to tell about everything, because no one will help, except to write here. Help please; (",
1,", at first I did not want to write, but I can no longer live like this. To tell someone that I want to commit suicide I am ashamed. Everyone considers me a balanced and calm person. But after recent events I often look for ways to commit suicide. The worst thing happened a year ago, my cat died, which I loved very much, it may seem strange, but for me this is the end of my life ... I saw him dead by the road, and if not for a friend, most likely I would have been hit by a car ... Sometimes I don’t understand myself, I’m scared, I don’t realize what I’m doing. I don’t care what is happening around I only think about death. Several times I wanted to kill myself with pills, but I didn’t have enough willpower. My whole life is focused on learning. And I love dogs, I had 2 of them, but my parents gave them both away, they don't like them. And for me, this is life. Nobody understands me, everyone says that I am crazy with dogs. But I just love them very much. And then the death of the cat, they took the dog away. I have nightmares every night. I don’t want to live without them. It seems to me that I will do something, I will not bear another fight over the dogs. I'M SCARED !!!",

1,"My name is Olga. I am 31 years old. Three years ago, I encouraged the whole family to move to another city.",
1,". My name is Garik. My story began when I worked for a very powerful wealthy man in the city. He helped me cope with a small problem for him, which was very huge for me. So to speak, I saved from the assaults of bandits, since at that time I worked successfully, earning a lot of money. I have a full-fledged beloved family, a one-year-old daughter is growing up. There is someone to live for, take care of, protect. When they helped me, I agreed with the man to work together, so to speak, under his tutelage in the city. Everything turned out fine, as before, but over time, the influential person became more demanding of me, loaded me with additional problems that I tried to solve in the process of my work. And the man remained dissatisfied all the time. Since I am by nature a very Gentle person, with soft character traits, I endured everything. One of the tasks was to sell his expensive car, since my field of activity was the auto business. Nobody allocated money to solve problems with maintenance, driving a car, they had to do everything for their own money. So I sold Her for a year and a half, and there was no result, the person wanted an exclusive very large amount for his car, for which not everyone is ready to buy. The buyers of such cars are politicians, businessmen, show business stars. I was constantly fucked when I sell this car. I kind of decided to help sell the car, but later he started hanging this car on me, they say, take it and give me 55 thousand greenbacks. I don't even have that kind of money while successfully working, well, there are 5 thousand set aside for a rainy day, well, there is a car and an apartment in which I live with my family. And then one of these days, the boss starts gouging me about the sale of a car, I say that the car should be driven to the capital, put in a car dealership and maybe there will be a result. On this day, I had no personal funds, as we were preparing to replenish the family, repairs were being made in the apartment, and I told the boss that I had no money to drive the car away. To which he replied that he had heard this for the second week, took out the money and gave it. By this action, I understand that the car must be driven away and delivered. That night I got into an accident on it. Broke badly. He himself was left intact, a little dirty, his head was broken, his ribs hurt. I called the traffic police, having examined the place of the accident, they did not even draw up a report on me, since it was not my fault. Only my car was involved in the accident. There was also an accident on the road ahead of me, and there were chips for 500 meters away, there was not even a patrol car and traffic police officers, nothing else that indicated that traffic was blocked. I said that I had an accident, to which they told me that you bought this car. I didn't get scared for myself, for my wife, child, because I didn't have that much money to buy this car. It was not enough to sell EVERYTHING, and that would not have been enough to get into debt, although no one would have helped (when such a grief happens, then all friends disappear, they are not). I understand that I have doomed my family to wander through life. I often think that I am superfluous in this world, and at the same time I understand that I cannot leave my family in this way. I want to leave this world .......",

Today I looked at psychologists on the Internet, how expensive ... one session from 1500 rubles. I torture myself with my depression ... Relations with my father did not improve, after he received a stroke, time passed and he began to drink again ... everything returns to normal.

1,"Здравствуйте. Мне очень нужна помощь, больше мне не кому рассказать. Возможно это будет смешно, но в мои 16 лет я не хочу жить. Я постараюсь кратко описать все что случилось. Когда мне быть 14 , я встретила парня( ему 16) , которого полюбила, и поняла что лучше никого не будет( звучит возможно смешно, но так и выходит ) дело в том, что мои родители не знали чем я занимаюсь, а именно : гуляю, пью, курю, друзья и компания ужасные . И в такой момент он и появился.. Он был домашним. Он был со мной, тоже влюбился, но понимал что я веду себя отвратительно. Сейчас я понимаю что виной всему моя глупость, и отсутствие контроля, я попросту не знала, что плохо, а что хорошо. И вот.. пробыли не мы вместе не месяца 4.. Один раз я даже наврала ему, сказав что парень с которым я гуляла - мой брат. Хотя он был всего лишь из компании.Скоро он меня бросил. Время проходило, но до сегодняшнего дня мне все еще не было так больно как тогда, кому я и рассказывала - это подруге . Он травил меня , говорил что живу ужасно, но я попросту не понимала что не так. Я не знаю как не забралась в петлю, но все же ногу порезала, лежала в больнице месяц, слава Богу хожу. Но хочу отметить, что это было не для того чтобы показать ему как я могу, а от своей боли. Он появлялся редко, сам не мог определиться что со мной делать, моя боль была не выносимой... Спустя месяца 3 мне встречается другой парень , я совсем запуталась , забыла совсем где черное и где белое, и от потери какого-либо решения была с ним. Первые половые отношения. С ним мы порвали через 2 месяца, мне не жаль ни капли. И вот , спустя еще пол года, я пишу тому самому, мне снова стало так больно.. Снова вернулось то чувство, что больше жить не за чем без него, сначала он подумал что я решила ему мстить, но после все же мы начали встречаться. А теперь самое важное : он ценил меня за душу, верность, и преданность, радовал неся что я чистая и принадлежу только ему. Он так сильно любил меня ... все шло лучше чем по маслу, и вот спустя полтора года, мы расстаемся .. Почему? Я врала ему на счет прошлого, говорила что я девственница.. Это и есть причина расставания. Я призналась ему сама, потому что совесть замучила, он ведь ценил только за это, а я была по глупости, тупости и наивности уже этого лишена . За все время он отучил меня от социума, у меня нет друзей, они совершенно мне не были нужны пока я была с ним, я всегда сидела дома, если гуляю то только с ним, я была счастлива что изменилась . Но что мне делать сейчас? Он не простил меня, все что он ценил я убила, так еще не и врала ему полтора года что девственница. Две недели он держался, был со мной но каждый день потыкал меня, говорил что я шлюх ееа, я себя испортила, и сломала ему жизнь. Для него моя невинность - особенно важно, он берег себя и наткнулся на меня .. Я попросту ненавижу себя, я хочу умереть, я убила все что у него ко мне было, что же делать? Как вернуть?? Я не вынесу второго расставания , я умру. Я говорила ему, что я была глупая и сожалею ужасно, не говорила что врала дабы не потерять его, хотела начать все с чистого листа с ним. Но ни в какую. Все что он ценил убито, хранил себя не для той.. Что же теперь? Я сама убила все своим враньем и тем что сделала тогда, он совсем не хочет говорить со мной, сказал забыть все что было. Но как же мне жить дальше? Есть ли шанс его вернуть? Что я могу для него сделать? Я на все готова, я не могу отказаться от него, к тому же я уверена что в его душе есть еще что-то ко мне.. Что же теперь?",

1,"Всем доброго дня!Маялась в инете с надеждой успакоить и настроить себя на позитив!Стала искать статьи о криках души,о помощи чтоб узнать ,а много нас таких или все таки я начинаю сходить с ума в поисках счастливой жизни.Наверно инет самое удобное место где можно ""кричать"" бумага все стерпит.История моя началась далеко не вчера и не сегодня,а с того мамента когда я родилась.Сегодня мне 46 и я ни как не могу избавиться от этого груза.Конечно рассказ начну с того,что мне рассказывала мама,а далее уже четко из памяти,которую ни как не могу очистить.Думаю что таких как я не мало и все мы боримся,боримся...Вообщем началось все с того что меня родила мама когда ей было 18, папа на 5 лет старше.Не слюбилось,не сраслось.Папа начал погуливать во время беременности и после родов.Ушел от нас когда мне было 2 года.Жили мы в бараке,который нужно было отапливать печным отоплением и носить воду с колонки.Видимо тут и сорвались нервы,мама уходила в запой,меня передавали как эстафетную палочку от соседа к соседу от родствинника к родствиннику.Устроили с чьей то помощью в круглосуточный сад,далее школа с продленными днями,школа собирала бумаги на материальную помощь,даже помню как зимнее пальто мне купили и я была оочень рада.Мама периодически приходила в себя,снова красавица и совсем не похоже на алкашку.Когда меня дразнили,кидалась в драку на защиту мамы.Ну и понятно круг общения во дворе,подобные дети.Другие с нами как тогда говорили не водились.Мама пыталась устроить свою личную жизнь,появлялись какие то новые папы и пропадали.И опять все заканчивалось запоями.Было ли у мамы общение с папой я не знаю,но то что меня начали делить,вернее не меня,а алименты что папа платил на меня,для меня.Сылался папа на то,что мама пропивает все деньги,по какой причине меня должна кормить и одевать школа.Вообщем дело дошло до суда и лишения родительских прав.Из родителей на суд никто не явился.После суда из родственников меня никто не забрал, я оказалась в школе-интернате для детей сирот и лишенных родительских прав.Теперь двое родителей платили алименты в пользу государства.Мама старалась в течении года восстановила права и забрала меня домой.Но и тут мое счастливое детство и радость быстро закончилось.Снова запои,отсутствие дома.И тут я сама вновь пришла к своему классному руководителю в школе- интернате с просьбой забрать меня обратно.В подростковом возрасте примерно 8 класс,обьявила байкот школе и сбежала,в интернате нас постоянно унижали и напоминали чьи мы дети.Жила у какой то девочки видимо раньше учились вместе.Беглянку нашли,привезли в интернат и поставили на учет по делам не совершенно летних.На летний период меня оформляли в трудовой отряд старшекласников,пололи грядки.В учебный период мыла кабинеты и все это за небольшие деньги,примерно рублей 30 получала.По окончании школы ,устроилась на работу.Жила дома,где продолжались пьянки примерно месячными запоями.На тот момент мама вышла замуж,родила двоих деток.Так что когда была так скажим на веселе,детками занималась я.Скаждым днем я ненавидила обстановку.Хотелось бежать,кричать...но куда? И как обычно бывает оказалась приглашенной на новогоднюю вечеринку,где познакомилась с парнем.Он оказался самым трезвым и у него я искала защиту от пьяных парней,сама я не пила.Встречались не долго,предложил выйти замуж.С удовольствием согласилась.Хотелось любви,семью.С родителями жениха познакомилась за месяц до свадьбы.Узнав чья я дочь,у свекровки проснулась""безумная любовь""ко мне.Гнобила как могла,но конечно в отсутствии мужа и свекра.Жаловалась,плакала,рассказывала мужу какое отношение его матери ко мне.Защита конечно была но опять не надолго.Ушел в запой,пристрастился играть в азартные игры.Проигрался,сбежал.Обьявив что деньги у меня.На тот момент я уже родила и сыну было 8 месяцев.И опять ад.Выносили двери в поисках мужа и денег.Находясь в декретном отпуске кое как закончила мед училище.Устроилась на работу в детский сад.Вообщем все сыты и сын при мне.В лет так 25 когда мне было,приехал мой папа ко мне на пмж,приняла,но не надолго.Бухать любит.Попросила чтоб сьехал пока я на работе.Муж обьявился,прощение просил.Жизнь сначала решили начать.Собрали вещи и уехали в другой город.Здесь просто не возможно было жить.Долг так и весел и периодически наведывались узнать,а где же мой муж? Сначала жить не получилось-расстались!Сын рос,посещал на каникулах бабушек.Я работала,жили в сьемной квартире.Тяжко ой как тяжко.И так 10 лет.Меняла жилье,работу.Сын вырос,встретил девушку,живут.Невестку я не видила кроме как на фото.Отношения с родителями так и не сложились,но сыну не запрещала гостить у них.Вроде все уравновесилось,жила как могла.Встретила мужчину,предложил на переезд и я согласилась.И вот опять другой город.По прошествию времени у вновь испеченного мужа,стали проявлятся привычки,алкоголика и безработицы.Я работала,ему(нам)помогали родители,подкидывали рублики.Прожили два года.В чужом городе одна.Истерика,разочарования.Но взяла себя в руки и продолжала жить.На работе я пользуюсь уважением.В одном из отпусков была приглашена на дачу на др,и тут я опять знакомлюсь.Встречаемся,созваниваемся,ходим в гости.Предложил переехать к нему,условия-уволиться с работы.И я как тупая овечка,оставляю свою аренду,работу,в надежде на счастье,слава Богу есть мужики.Но не тут то было.По факту не работает,любитель выпить.День дублируется изо дня в день.Засасывает в трясину..Вот и полезла в инет,читать форумы психологов как из себя вновь сделать Менхаузена!) отписалась и легче стало!) Теперь вновь в поиске работы и своего жилья,пусть и аренда! Но связывать свою жизнь с мужчинами и надеждой жить что с ними легче ,ни коем образом не буду!Не стала описывать как сложилась жизнь маминых деток от второго брака.Это уже их жизнь.Но скажу что не лучшим образом...Мама похоронила супруга,пить бросила.Но та уже другая история.",

I am not a murderer, although I have always been skeptical about childbirth, perhaps the child should be left - this is someone else's life, I’m not ruining it. I decided to bring my attempts to death. I am angry, irritable, frivolous - it was always like this. How to raise a child if I already hate him ?? I do not believe in giving birth and falling in love, I have heard many stories about how women failed to love a child. I have problems with this love in general - I have never loved anyone, but I wanted to destroy myself all my life, a miracle saved me. Plus I am engaged in creativity, I am famous in my field .. What kind of creativity with a screaming lump next to me? The child's father is incredibly happy , fusses, promises to do everything to make it as easy for me as possible. He really loves me, fool. My life is like a sticky swamp, nothing makes me happy (it was always like this, but I was alone and knew how to live with it). and there is no money ... not for my own housing, not even for a psychotherapist.

But how can you meet someone if you don't leave the house. I fell in love with one person, but he didn't even want to recognize me, he didn't like my appearance. And I still cannot forget about him. Also, I have a fear of relationships because the doctors told me that it would be difficult for me to conceive, or I might not give birth at all.

Because of this, I developed a ugly complex. And all one by one. And how can I live in this world, I have nothing, I live for my family, I help parents and sisters with children.

She graduated from high school with a gold medal, a music school, a university with honors, a magistracy, she could be a psychologist, she showed great promise. The first time she got married at 21, due to pregnancy, a son was born, left her husband. She left because I was loved by the teacher, who was 33 years older than me, and was married. He took care of me, helped. She got pregnant from him. I lived with my parents, my mother could not come to terms with this shame, suffered, drove me out of the house. I left in the ninth month of pregnancy with my son to a rented apartment. Only a week before the birth, the father of the future child left his wife. Everything was hard: curses, humiliation, shame. Have survived. A daughter was born. Have signed. The husband was given a hostel. We moved. Mom gets sick with oncology, blames me for future death. Dies. On the eve of my death, I was picked up by an ambulance, diagnosed with bipolar-affective disorder. Mania gives way to depression. Since 2010, two hospitalizations, registration in the PND. In 2013, they get into the local folk theater, the director seduces me, in a manic phase I leave home, without money, without work, without children. The guardianship authorities take away the son, the father does not give the daughter away. She lived alone. In an unfurnished apartment, which belongs to my son and should have belonged to me too, but my sister took over my share, seeing my condition. The doctor suggested a disability group. I agreed, thereby negating the opportunity to work in my specialty, build a career and live in general. A year ago, my husband allowed him to live with him and his daughter in a hostel. But: for all the time that I did not live here, it fell into disrepair. It was destroyed by two dogs, three cats, a rabbit, a parrot, which I dragged into the house in a maniacal, starting in 2010. Horror, dirt that no one cleaned up, torn wallpaper, torn furniture, scratched jambs. And it's all thanks to me. The son has been growing up for three years without me. Grew up already. He is 15. Lives with his grandparents. Comes for the weekend. It's unbearable: my son grew up without me !!! While I was doing something unknown, I fluttered in the illness, maintaining the hypomanic stage in myself. Daughters are now 11. I also missed two years. I miss it now. I cry constantly. I understand that my husband is 71. And when he is gone, the daughter will be taken away. There is no official job. I went to the labor exchange. All they can find for me is probably a cleaning job. The husband is still working. Not enough money. Dressed poorly. I didn’t raise children, I became nothing, I destroyed myself. From a beautiful, well-dressed, smiling young woman, mother, I turned into a fat, old, ugly aunt. I wear second-hand hoodies, sports shoes. A state of fear, depression, not being realized in anything. Self-blame, self-flagellation, self-destruction, hatred. Unwillingness to live. It is impossible to live. How? A sticky state of terror. There is no future. Help. Well, at least somehow, what to cling to?",
1,"Моя история жизни сложна. Ребенок родившийся на развале союза в обычной семье. Мама ткачиха,отец пом.мастер.Жили в общежитие, потом родители получили квартиру и в 92году война, которую моя память не хочет помнить. Но потом родители без работы, отец запил а мама боролась за семью. Хлеб привозили один раз в день и нас детишек с паспортами выстраивались в очередь. Со временем обстановка изменилась но не в семье, стало ещё хуже. И мы с мамой обходили часами магазины и покупали хлеб а потом мама чуть дороже продавала его в ближайшем селе. Когда бабушка с дедушкой умерли то достался дом в наследство и отец уехал в деревню а я, сестра старшая и мама остались в городе. Мама каждые выходные уезжала к отцу а мы оставались учиться, но каждые каникулы мы тоже уезжали в деревню. Потом сестра поступила учиться в медицинский колледж в другом городе и мама бралась за любую работу. Всю жизнь у мамы были длиннющие роскошные волосы и она их обрезала и продала чтобы дать сестре денег на неделю, к отцу стали ездить реже. Мама как-бы переключилась со спасения отца на обучение сестры. В школу я ходила беднющим ребенком, без тетрадей, ручек,и в старых завершенных вещах. Приходилось сложно так как насмехались и очень часто лет с одиннадцати я оставалась дома одна и прогуливал школу. Садилась в автобус, доезжала до конечной и сидела на лавочках. Соответственно пробелы в знаниях и успеваемость упала. Дома есть было нечего, но маме я рассказывала что в школе у меня друзья все и как там весело. Потом мама перестала ездить к отцу совсем, меня отправили в тринадцать лет к отцу и все каникулы я провела там. Отец занимался на работу а деньги отдавал мне а я их не тратила а собирала в бабушкина коробку из под чая. Могла у соседей купить сметану домашнюю и хлеб. Как подросток целыми днями болталась по улицам,играла но вечером бежала на остановку и ждала маму а она не приезжала. Поначалу отец не пил но потом вместо денег с ним расплачивались вином. И я увидела что он принес вино и когда пошел он спать, то вылила. Когда отец проснулся то ругался и прижал к стене и замахнулся, до этого меня не били совсем.  Но отец остановился, остыл и извинился. А еще у меня был гастрит и когда был очередной приступ я дома была одна из было так больно, я лежала на земле и ела траву, мне ее заваривали до этого и сказали что она полезная. Так было все лето, и дни перестали радовать, я одна. Пыталась хозяиничать, мыла полы, стирала отцовские вещи,взрослела. В конце августа сестра приехала забирать меня, отец спросил почему мама не приехала но ответа не было. В итоге сестра забрала все что я накопила с отцом не оставив ему совсем ничего. Когда уехали отец дал маме две недели на то чтобы она приехала. Но мама так и не поехала. В декабре утром когда я выходила в школу нам позвонили и сказали что отца убили, мы поехали в деревню. Сумбур не помню, возня,плач, люди. Кругом кровь, мне дали швабру чтобы я отмывала, страшно, все в крови. Отца побили, молодые ребята, а потом добили его. Когда отца привезли то я его не узнала, только по пальцу руки, это старый перелом который  криво зажил. По традициям тело три дня в доме, приходят люди прощаться,а ночью женщины молитвы поют. Меня усадили в комнате с отцом сидеть, когда оставалась одна то зажигала больше свечей, было так страшно. Вот в этот момент кончилось детство. Отца похоронили. Мы уехали в город, мама стала беспомощной что-ли, она работала, так же не хватало средств но что-то изменилось в маме. Потом мама уехала в Москву на заработки, мыла вагоны на киевском, и так было два года. Я одна в квартире, сестра в колледже и приезжала только на выходные. Я поступила в техникум учиться на швею, год перебивалась мама денег не присылала, иногда были посылки, шла в общежитие к студентам и там иногда удавалось поесть. И техникум спустя год я бросила. В очередной голодный день открыла газету и нашла объявление о наборе девочек. Поехала в соседний город, к первому клиенту я поехала девственницей, здоровый пьяный Виктор. Когда сказала ему не поверил, и завалил и первый акт без контрацепции был отвратительным,и так до утра было. На утро я получила деньги и в магазине купила копченный окорочек. Или так иногда выходила так работать и понеслось, мужчины,мужчины,и потом меня продали в Москву, я ехала без документов,проводники на таможне сами договаривались. С поезда меня встретили и привезли в квартиру с такими матерыми девками, вечером нас отвезли на точку,на ленинградке напротив огромный торговый центр гранд. И вот он ужас. Девочки отьезжали с клиентами и некоторые не приезжали а некоторые потом появлялись искалеченные. Но меня все это обходилось стороной. Было много клиентов, а было и очень много и они делали все что хотели со мной,а потом приехал Игорь который разрешил остаться у себя, и я осталась. Готовила,убирала и ждала его вечером с работы, я забеременела и он меня выгнал. Или снова я на улице. Опять же газета и первый же номер взял меня на работу о беременности я скрыла, и так продолжалось пока живот меня не выдал, но меня отправили работать в другое место. И за месяц до родов волею судьбы я поехала к клиенту который дал мне денег достаточно для того чтобы уехать домой. За полтора года ада я еду домой, но мне рады были не долго, ровно столько радовались пока у меня не кончились деньги. Первый осмотр врача был на восьмом месяце, роды и у меня здоровенький голубоглазый мальчишка. Сестра отвернулась,мама стыдилась того что я принесла в подоле. Когда сыну было шесть месяцев, я связывала крепко грудь и шла работать на местную швейную фабрику. Мы так было три года и знакомая предложила поехать в Москву на швейную фабрику. И я сделала паспорт загранпаспорт и поехала и это маленькое помещение с узбекскими бригадами где за пошив изделия платили 17рублей, вот и шила сутками чтобы хоть 500-800рублей заработать. Потом перешла работать на местную столовую и работодатель меня уволилась и я снова проститутка. К сыну я езжу регулярно,в доме достаток,мне 31, образования 9классов, жизнь пустая.. Несмотря на этот опыт вредных привычек у меня нет совсем,но нет ощущениЯ будущего, я не знаю как жить.",
1," ... I am writing this for the first time ... I am tired both mentally and physically ... I am mired in debt ... if it were not for a small child, I would have committed suicide long ago ... well, I don’t know what to do anymore. .. There was a mother with diabetes, strokes, heart attacks .. in general, she took money for hospitals ... and now a lot of interest ... I met a man and married him, everything is fine with him, but he also had a very large debt, and I also got it ... since I was in the hospital for 6 months - medications, you know what kind of medicine I kept on them throughout my pregnancy ... They gave them away, then they took them again, because there was simply nothing to live for ... I also raised 2 children myself, now we are raising three children together, since my mother abandoned them when they were little ... I'm writing confusing, sorry ... Mom died - the funeral was very expensive, then a letter came from one bank - against me - I borrowed I have dollars from a friend - I paid the bank - now I'm collecting the debt to give her, and now my husband at work - a collection has come from the bank and They take a large amount from salaries, I am on maternity leave - I receive very little money for a child, and two older ones - teenagers - are also studying. The situation in the country is terrible - utility bills - my dad pays, because we don't even have enough for food ... I don't know why I'm writing here, I'm just tired, I don't know what to do and how to fight, in our country everything is not fair for ordinary people...",
1,"I do not want to formulate the problem in the spirit of ""I want to die, help"". But I don’t know where to start listing the things that make me sad. I'm not even sure where exactly it lies, the main reason that I always, my entire conscious life, feel bad. Every day I live with the thought that everything in my life has long gone awry, that I have let all the possibilities down the drain, that all my dreams will never come true and that I am the only one to blame for this. I am tormented by a feeling of guilt towards many people, and especially towards my mother and father, towards my younger sister. They do not like me in my soul, but they do not seem to notice that I am really a bad, lost person, and they will only be disappointed in me. I am tormented by eternal anxiety for everything in the world. I always live without knowing what will happen to me in a year or even in a month. The feeling that everything will be very bad in the end is oppressive, and every year it only gets worse. Since I was 15, almost not a day in my life goes by without obsessive thoughts of suicide. I am so accustomed to them that they are now more annoying than frightening. I cannot stand quietly on the station platform or look down from a height. I have nightmares and disgusting insomnia that only helps me get drunk. This is another grave problem. I am becoming an alcoholic. I usually drink one and a lot to go to bed and immediately switch off. I don’t want to do this anymore, because of alcohol there have already been more serious problems, and thank God that I have never caused trouble to anyone other than myself.",
1,"I lived like everyone else worked, I had a family, but suddenly I got sick. Brain tumor, face half working. The doctors in the clinic are laughing. The husband left. I started a calendar, waiting for my son to finish his studies and I can die in peace. I am so proud, strong, crushed, offended by the whole world. I have asked the question why me many times, but such is the fate, she throws out the extra. The only thing I regret is that there are no friends next to me, but here I was to blame for the family. Sorry, it just boiled. I am alone, I am sick no one needs me, how I lost myself. The soul is empty, deaf, hopeless. Forgive me life wasted you.",
1,"Communication problems were still in school, and from the time of the same school, parents made it clear that a good attitude would only be provided if they studied well. After school, I immediately entered the university for the first specialty I took - computer science, hoping that contacts with people would be minimal. I graduated normally for 3 years, 4 out of 4 turned out to be a turning point - interest disappeared, because they didn't really teach anything, and they don't think, they only demand (a point). I still understand a little in my specialty, I advise my acquaintances on general issues, but I don't want to do programming when teachers are always pressing on my tail. I stopped going to university, I keep an eye on the house, my old grandmother, I gradually improve my knowledge in design - I like it, plus I can write stories.",
1,"My mother does not consider me, they try to humiliate me at school, no one cares about me and my opinion. With my mother, constant scandals over little things. Recently, very often began to think about suicide.",
1,"I think I really need help. I don't know exactly which one and from whom, I only know that the comforting words of loved ones do not help, constant work also does not allow one to escape from bad thoughts. Maybe I'll find something here that will save me. I want to hope so.",
1,"I don't know how long I have been in this state, perhaps a year, at least, but the thought of suicide has already become a kind of raison d'être, just waiting for the right moment. The feeling of fatigue is to blame, and not just fatigue from various problems, illnesses and responsibilities, but from life itself, in principle, as from a phenomenon of being. I'm tired of seeing, hearing, feeling, thinking, in the most literal sense of these words. And I try to fight this when I have at least a little strength, I try to meet more often with family and friends, engage in all kinds of self-development, spend more time in the fresh air, but all this is not the same. Tired of communicating with people, as if I had already discussed with all of them all the existing topics up and down, as if they were all some kind of stuck plastic; tired of looking for a really significant goal, which I would like to devote myself entirely to and which would bring real benefit; tired of seeing all these streets, houses, trees ... even in the most beloved places, I am so overcome by a feeling of powerlessness that I just want to lie down on a bench or on the grass, close my eyes and fall into an eternal, cloudless dream, the only thing that continues to please me. Sometimes there is even a feeling that all this is not happening to me. As if all this activity is performed by some kind of empty doll, pretending to be alive, sometimes very convincingly, but in which the real me is actually locked, beating inside in hysterics from the inability to escape and only in dreams feeling true joy and freedom. But dreams end, so why not do the same with life?",
1,"Здравствуйте. В моей жизни всё стало таким запутанным.Будто что-то оборвалось и без этого я не уже не смогу нормально жить. Меня многое постоянно беспокоит. Учеба, отношения, мой характер,будущее...Я понимаю, что нужно смириться со своими проблемами и жить дальше, плыть по течению...но не могу. Не знаю с чего начать,чтобы успокоиться и идти дальше. Ничего не понимаю. В голове один бардак. Если честно не знаю как расставить  все свои мысли по полочкам и разобраться в себе самостоятельно. Потому я и прошу помощи. Может быть ваши советы смогут хоть немного мне подсказать правильную дорогу,направить на тот путь,что сделает меня счастливой. По сути я должна быть такой. У меня есть всё что нужно для хорошего будущего. Родители замечательные, работают много и стараются для того, чтобы мы все жили хорошо.Я их очень люблю и они меня тоже. В учебе всё относительно. Что-то получается, что-то нет. Но каждый раз,когда я получаю плохую оценку или когда меня обижают одноклассники,прихожу домой, закрываю дверь и кулаками бью себя по животу, по рукам и ногам, чтобы прийти в себя. Это помогает немного успокоиться.Но так нельзя. У меня уже всё в синяках,прятать это уже не получается. Также я ненавижу свою внешность, можно сказать, что любой образ мне всё равно будет казаться ужасным. Что бы я ни делала,всё меня раздражает. Ненавижу себя и всё тут. А за что? Что я такого плохого делаю? И тут я понимаю, что ненавидеть себя просто не за что. Но что-то мне мешает принять себя такой какая я есть. Например мой характер. Я постоянно плачу.Ни один день не обходиться без этого. Но так мне удается снять напряжение, поэтому это единственное,что мне помогает. Я могу менять свое мнение очень часто. Сегодня я ненавижу это, завтра полюблю... Например я не люблю смотреть на парочек,которые держатся за руки,целуются у всех на виду. Сразу хочется от такой картины уйти подальше и не вспоминать это всё. На следующий день мне предлагают встречаться и я соглашаюсь. Где логика? Если мне не нравятся отношения, то почему я согласилась на простое признание?наверное потому что я хочу быть любимой. Раздражает во мне это поведение. Я всего навсего двуличный человек. Или например я хочу жить одна в будущем, но я боюсь, что на меня возложиться ещё больше обязанностей. Тогда для этого нужен человек. А мне не очень нравятся люди. У них есть свои мысли и свои ценности в жизни. Найти своего человека для меня нереально, потому что мой характер тут же отпугнет.В принципе чего я ожидаю? Того, что буду жить как нормальные люди? Невозможно с моим страхом общения. Боюсь сказать глупость или задеть человека своими словами, даже не заметив этого. Боюсь,что надо мной будут все смеяться. Глупо, не так ли?Однако я всё время об этом думаю. Вбила себе в голову, что это должно быть именно так и не иначе. В общем, случай тяжелый. Особенно я разрываюсь от выбора жить мне или нет. Я не ощущаю себя кем-то. Постоянно ненавижу всё в себе, требуя от себя результатов. ""Я должна получить пять """"Я должна занять первое место""""Я должна...можно этот список повторять бесконечно. Если я не добьюсь всего этого, боюсь, что новая порция синяков от себя мне обеспечена. Так я воспитываю в себе неженку,которая только и делает, что ноет.Я выдумываю проблемы, знаю и это. Но это моментально вылетает у меня из головы и снова мне хочется страдать. Скажу честно были у меня попытки покончить с собой, но вспоминая родителей, мое сердце бьется всё чаще и чаще. Я не хочу, чтобы из-за меня они плакали и винили себя в моей смерти. Поэтому я сейчас пишу сюда ради облегчения своей души. Хочу высказаться всем вам,чтобы в голове моей было место для новых свежих размышлений о будущем. Куда я пойду, что буду делать,как жить дальше. Эти вопросы меня постоянно мучают и съедают меня изнутри. Чего я хочу, так это,чтобы моя душа обрела покой. Хочу на всё смотреть позитивно, ну или хотя бы проще относиться к жизни.Поэтому прошу вас, помогите мне пожалуйста.Заранее благодарю вас за желание помочь и поддержать в этот трудный момент. Желаю, чтобы в вашей жизни всё было хорошо.Здоровья,счастья,любви вам и всего самого наилучшего!",

I study perfectly well, go to a medal and all that, on trial the highest points from the parallel, but I cannot be an ordinary nerd, I communicate with many, including ""difficult"" teenagers, but this does not affect my academic performance in school, as well as these teachers, for 11 years they were everything to me, I happily communicated with them, and, damn it, they were my idols, but I was disappointed in them, it's even impossible to describe, I lost heart, I do not want anything, and returning to the topic of ""difficult"" teenagers, this is a label that the teacher put on children who are not like everyone else, among them I found one with which I can just get mad, walk around and not think about anything else that's really cool. But my teacher, who for me is now the only person in school to whom I can fully open up, told me that I fell in her eyes, because I communicate with the ""wrong"" ones, it hurts me.

Once I was not accepted for work because of my eyes (they thought I was a disabled person). As a child, they wanted to take a disability, but I was shy. I have the feeling that I never succeed. All the works I found before midnight. The house considers me to be a naive, stupid fool, does not allow. Although I'm 21 soon I'm like a little teenager inside. I have failed more than ten interviews during this time and I am very worried about my future. Everyone knows that I have not been able to get a job for a long time (neighbors, acquaintances) they all know my story, they look with pitiful eyes. My love for life is slowly fading away.

1,"Girls! How much of this word is entangled in the man's chest. For each he is his own. For some, it is simple, for others, not very. Mine is sea. For you cannot untangle. Do you think you got confused in your love affairs? It's funny. Hehe, haha. I almost smiled. There is none of them. Not at all. And it is not expected. Why? A simple question, and so many answers ... Well, first of all, my smile. Yes, yes, the usual smile, except that it looks like the smile of the Joker from the comics about Batman. Laughter is about the same. I tried to change them - it would be better not to touch them. Due to a defect in the bite or whatever it is and a pair of teeth, the default smile cannot be good. To treat is expensive, money is not. So we hold on as we were advised. At least I began to control laughter ... Sometimes ... But not all of it keeps on smiling and laughing, is it? I agree, because there is another problem - my sense of humor. Black. Agree that not every girl can withstand such humor. But people with an even worse sense of humor find a mate and nothing. What are you doing here then, sufferer? But why. Another problem, my character. Due to bullying at school, he deteriorated somewhat. A little bit. Just a little bit. But it's still worth throwing it away. You can and me together, so as not to get bored in the mountain of garbage. So, after all these mockery about and without, I became very suspicious and distrustful. Besides, it's quite aggressive. I can make (And did) BBPE without any illumination of conscience.

I am a disgusting person, both inside and out. and every year everything only gets worse. and there is less and less chance that I will become the kind of person I consider worth living. dreams one by one are broken about the realities of life, and most likely I will remain nothing and nothing. I'll become even uglier, and I'll work as a dishwasher or cleaner all my life. there are so many cockroaches in my head that it makes no sense to rake them, and it seems that nothing will help.

1,"Здравствуйте.Захожу на этот сайт частенько,читаю просьбы и понимаю многих людей.Сегодня решил написать сам,незнаю зачем,но в надежде о помощи.Кому то может знакомо эта ситуация,и подскажет как с неё выбраться.В данный момент жизни испытываю пустоту,бещпомощьнось,аппатию,зависть,и жалость и злость на себя.Это делать нельзя,да я знаю. Я постараюсь донести свои мысли,убеждение.Не судите строго,это все на эмоциях.Начну с того что 7 месяцев назад полностью поменялось мировоззрение.Была психологическая травма-это потеря любимого человека.Я открыл свою душу ей,хотя и сам незнал что там творится.И тут понеслось.Переосмысливание всей жизни.Тогда только открылись глаза на это суровый мир.Дело в том что я не жил реальностью,жил в своем мирку много мечтал,чувствовал себя там безопасно.А когда открыл глаза стало очень страшно,как будто я один против целого мира.Выяснив это начал читать информацию в интернете.Все это началось с детсва,родители мои не развивались.Жили неблагополучно.Нас 7детей.Матались по квартирам,отец много пил и бил мать.Работал на стройках ни к чему не стремился.Мать в своем роде тоже человек без цели.Наклепали детей,а справиться не смогли.Тем самым с раниго детсва и пошли убеждения что я ни достоин лучшего,ни уважения ни любви. За мной не следили,не учили самостоятельности,не воспитывали вообще.Таким забитым и пошел в школу.Не ряшлив,наивный и глупый.Соответсвенно был жалкий,и был изгоем.В старших классах тоже самое,из за низкой самооценки был жалким.Для авторитета стал курить и прогуливать.Для своих желаний,и потребности воровал и подрабатывал на грязных работах.Друзья были при чем очень много,так как в детстве интересовался очень многим,от спорта,до творчества.Поступил после 9 в ПТУ на слесаря,так как ни финансово ни морально не потянул бы.Там тоже не гладко все,считали жалким.Так как я к тому же молчун.Боязнь сказать что то глупое.Много прогуливал,чтоб тоже казаться авторитетом среди одногруппников.Употреблял легкие наркотики в тех же целях.С раних лет боялся одиночества,и стремился быть любимым,мечтал иметь девушку.Но правда с этим было трудно,кто мне нравился,считали меня просто другом.Приходилось встречаться с теми кому нравился я.Страх сделать первые шаги,общение с ними.Эта неуверенность.После училища сразу же забрали в армию.Я даже толком и не понимал куда иду.В итоге это мое первое испытание жизни.В далеке от дома,неувереность и низкая самооценка не покидала.Много унижали,но не трогали из за жалости.Во второй половине службы накинули лычки.Ответсвеность,с самооценка возвысилась,но толку от это не было.Так как я очень добрый человек,к тому же слабак нормальным командиром не был .Так же везде присутствувала эта без помощьность.Во вемя дембеля я даже сам домой приехать не смог,просил сослуживцев по пути до бросить.Окощавшись дома.Погуляв неделю,отец забрал на стройку пахать на семью,как должное.Работал с ним,он мне не доверял ответсвенную работу ,тем самым работал подсобником.Местами где то что то научился,и работал сам.Вечерами проводил время с кружками попиваю пива и ходить по кабакам.Встречался с доступными девушками привлекая их своей добротой и доверчивость.Зачастую я уходил от них так как чувствовал что не мое либо не достоин даже их,искал что то лучше.С родными никогда не знакомились,так как я их призирали,точнее не долюблтвае.За их не ряшливость и ответсвеность за жизнь.Так шло время,грязная тупая работа,выпивки,гулянье поиски любимой девушки лижбы не быть одиноким.Знакомился только в чатах,так как боялся,точнее был не уверен подойти до девушек в живую.Однажды познакомился с девушкой.Мы долго с ней дружили.Она приехала к нам в небольшой городок работать по профессии.Она мне очень нравилась и я пытался добиться ее внимания,но из за этой неуверенности и жалости и страха тяжело получалось.Уделяя ей очень много времени мне это получилось сделать.Начали встречаться,я был по уши влюблен в нее ,точнее зависим.Она меня вдохновила,у меня поднялась самооценка,и появилась радость.Я стал стремятся для нее быть лучше.Уехав в командировки с отцом ,за короткий срок заработал 300 тысяч на автомобиль,познакомил ее с родителями.Они были рады,да и я к ним начал с любовью относиться.Но вдохновения не так долго длилось,до первой ревности.Она общительный,но в то же время очень наивный человек.Я постоянно боялся ее потерять,запрещял ей ходить с подругами по кафе,и сидеть в чатах.Пытался подстроить под себя и в то же время понимал что это невозможно.Я работал на стройках и жил не богато,да и бывало что месецами дома сидел.У меня было такое чувство что она меня тянет,и требует с меня то что я дать не могу.Это наверное из за моей никчемности.Шло время,были соры были и счастливые моменты.Она не могла иметь детей,но в тоже время стремилась поправить свое здоровье,я же наоборот говорил хочу их,но в душе не хотел,потому что был не уверен в себе,то что справлюсь,то что не хочу на свет подобия себя,такого же жалкого.Однажды она уехала к матери в гости,за сотни километров от меня.Я же не поехав с ней,не хотел знакомиться с родителями,откладывал все на потом.Еще и средств не было на поездку.Отпустил ситуации,доверился ей.Спустя несколько дней опять сора.Через неделю она мне звонит и говорит что не любит меня и изменила мне .У меня тяжелый стресс.Я не верил этому.проходит еще несколько дней и говорит что она выходит за муж,обвеняя меня в этом,то что я сам добился этого то что я ни развиваюсь,то что я трус,никчемный не достойный.Я ее слова принял близко к сердцу,меня она ими убила.Звонила она каждый день так как не отпускала,при этом живя с будущим мужем.Я же,так как боялся остаться один,брал трубку и общялся с ней.Начатался в форумах действия при возврате девушек и подорожал этому.Начало вроде получаться.Но обвал,она выходит замуж.Слезы у меня стресс.алкоголем глушил все.Хотел ехать и забрать ее но многие останавливали,да и сам маялся.И так продолжалось еще месяц постоянный звонки по телефону,ее слова что сделала ошибку ,что не хочет быть с ним.А свадьба это родителей так пожалела.Еще через месяц мы с ней встретились,и договорились быть вместе.Но уехав она опять обманула.Я ей не звонил с момента измены,постоянно выходила она на связь,так как я слабый но все таки держу себя и не подаю виду.И так продолжалось еще месяц,пока она окончательно перестала писать.Я много думал в течении всех этих месяцев,и решил менять свою жизнь.Через друзей устроился на работу,автоюрист.Бросил пить и курить,больше общался с людьми , в общем пошел против себя,своих страхов.Но это длилось не долго.Как то вечером она прислала СМС что беременна,и изменялась.Я сорвался,начал пить,лишился работы,соответсвенно и друзей.Лишился прав,чтобы отдать долги пришлось продать авто за копейки.Началь еще сильнее депрессия,все отвернулись,так как я им уже надоел своим нытьем о неудачной жизни.Психологии выманивают деньги,а толку нету.Интересса нету ни к чему.Вроде бы все конец,живу как овощь .Но проходит пару недель и эта девушка приезжает к нам в город в гости до подруг.Нашла меня,опять боль.Мы провили время вмести,она умоляла простить и очень хотела вернуться,в тоже время боялась мести.Я ее простил,с горем со слезами отправил обратно к матери,хоть и жалею.Я ее люблю сильно,но не могу в душе простить той боли,тех долгих мук.Я разрываюсь на части.Мы общяемся с ней,но я ее отдоляя от себя потихоньку,в тоже время ненавидя себя за это.За эти пол года очень сильно потерялась память,нервы пошатнулась.Сейчас работаю так же на стройке обычным подсобнок,и через знакомых устроился установщиком топливного оборудования ли ж бы выжить.Живу с родителями в одном дворе.Так же испытываю муки с ними.У меня небольшой дом,который построил мой брат до своей свадьбы,он остался мне так как он съехал.Сейчас после развода с женой,он живет со мной очень много пьет,не ряшлив ни к чему не стремиться.Так же вернулась младшая сестра беременная с мужем,итого нас в нашем дворе живет восемь человек.Ни кто из них не ухаживает за собой,ни к чему не стремиться,просто деградируют.Не убирают за собой,постоянная грязь.Разговоры не помогают.Я бы уехал,но куда?кто меня ждет.В нашем мире на каждом шагу кинуть могут.Да и старых родителей жалко,пусть я их не долюбливаю,но их я не брошу.А оставить их сестре или брату на присмотр,думаю врятли они кружку с водой поднесут.Вот так вот я живу и мучаюсь ,точнее существую.Больше всех я не долюбливаю мать-то что родила.Это не правильно,но установка у меня в голове.Я борюсь с собой,читаю что то где то как изменится.У меня огромное желание,но сил уже не хватает.Я себя чувствую овощем.Который не может исправиться.Ни чего ни хочу,просто пустота,я незнаю как жить теперь.Во всем виноват сам!!!! Вкус жизни пропал.Много завидую людям,которые состоялись.Друзей уже нету.Они строят свои семьи,да и зачем я им,унылый меланхолик.Новоя работа,не вызывает интереса,да что то там говорить я не умею общаться с людьми,смотреть им в глаза.Страх,и не понимая.Я элементарных вещей даже не понимаю,чувствую себя ничтожным и тупым.Хоби нету,да и не тянит ни к чему.Спорт?качалка,так же не уверенность,лень.В Храм?схожу,но врятли это поможет.я верю что есть Все видящий ,но не так как его описали люди.Я без характерный без силы воли.Я не могу ни дня без,кофе,без сигарет.Последнее время часто алкоголь.От того что однинок часто занимаюсь мастурбацией.Нету у меня будущего,я овощь.Обычное животное.Ни достоин любви,не собираюсь чтоб тащили такую обузу как я.Жалкую.девушку уже никогда не будет,работы и нормально й жизни тоже,так как все надо начать сначала.Это тяжело,так как я нахожусь на уровне обезьяны.мне 25 и я потерял свое время.Во всем виноват я сам!И помочь могу себе только сам.Но зачем?Семьи не будет,работы нормальной не будет,жилья не будет.Трудно жить в этом образе неудачника.Я незнаю что делать..Как себя побороть,как поставить себе цели,как поверить в себя.Я не хочу умирать,да и не собираюсь от своих рук.Но жить так не могу.Еще не много и я сдамся...",

1,"! There was one misfortune with which I cannot accept. A neighbor moved out of my dormitory. We didn’t get along, he didn’t like me and he called me Dodik ""nerd"". When he moved out, he started spreading dirty rumors to everyone to blame me that I was a nerd, fucking, and also called me gay because I don't have a girlfriend and behave like a chick. So, he began to get disheveled to all his friends, teams, guards, they began to spread rumors throughout the hostel. Now I just cannot leave without ridicule, reproaches, whispering in my direction. I cannot rent an apartment in Moscow, I work as a laboratory assistant and earn 7-10 thousand rubles a month, and then I can barely manage to cope with my studies. Now I don't get along with everyone. We all hate and despise, I became an outcast. Now I feel very bad. I hear the neighbors behind the wall start laughing wildly and gossiping behind the wall about me calling me gay, they dragged me that I molested my neighbor and therefore he moved away from me. I do not know how to be. I cannot deduct, I have 2 years of study left. I can't rent an apartment either, it's too expensive. I was looking for people who would also shoot, but I also cannot trust strangers, this is my credo. I myself am from another city, so I cannot live with them. I am simply torn apart by their provocative and false gossip. Sometimes it makes me want to commit suicide <ed. Mod.>.

1,"Greetings to all. I am a teenager, I am 15 years old, but internally I feel like an old man, the reason for this is the events that happened to me 2 years ago. It was 2 years ago that my mother and sister and I moved to another city where most of our relatives live. Dad stayed there. It so happened that from a busy metropolis, I plunged into complete emptiness. If before I lived normally in the city, studied, had the Internet, etc., then with the move to another city I lost it all. Now I live in a quiet village with my family, I go to an old school, which has not been renovated probably since the time of Genghis Khan. There, too, everything is not in tune, among today's peers I have not adapted, I just do that I sit all the lessons in a row at a desk holding a book in my hands, I don’t talk to anyone, I don’t play all the children here seem to me different.

I don't have my own family, my relatives are always glad to me, but I understand that everyone has their own families, we need to distance ourselves. I don't want anything, I'm not interested in anything. I'm used to living for others, I don't know how to live my life. I don’t know how to meet and don’t want to. I understand that life goes by, you can't. This caused panic and constant anxiety that I was missing something important in life. I went to church and still go.

1,"Now I am 17 years old and I regret that I was born. From the moment I started becoming a teenager, I began to think about grades, about myself, who I am. And then everything started rolling. Yes, and psychological problems came from school, that I study badly, but I could not study better, then there are no friends, and that I am not beautiful and all that. Then I did not know what to talk to people about, when the shyness had passed, and even now I don’t know. Well, then the problems remained the same and stronger, only I hate myself more and cry even more. I used to want to die, commit suicide, but after one dream in which I felt like I was dying in the arms of my mother, I no longer wanted to die. But the self-loathing and the feeling of regret that was born remained. I hate myself for being 17 and have not achieved anything in life. That I have remained the same three-woman, I can’t do anything well, I’m only lazy more, I don’t know what to talk to people about, I’m constantly whining, vulnerable, YES, and it doesn’t matter that I’m such a dull person, that I’m not an interesting person out of this. With all this, I have a golden mother. She is not like everyone else. Although she finished 8th grade, by the age of 48 her colleagues at work (with a higher education) think that she also has a higher education. For all her years she read books, was interested in everything possible. And she scolded me a little in childhood, but in my adolescence she taught me life. Yes, and I appreciate her that she raised me and her brother alone. My father died when I was 5. And I appreciate her, love and respect her. But I only blame that she gave birth to me. Of course, I understand that we have been studying all our lives, but in order to learn to be an actor, you need to finish 11 classes and go to study at the theater. But it's too late for me. studying to be a cutter. I hate studying. You have to pass the deadline. And I don't have time. it is necessary to think over questions on literature. Even though I’m a first year student, I’m afraid they’ll be kicked out of there. Now I’m trying not to be lazy, to do at least something, to think about good things, but I’m ruining everything for myself. I'm afraid that I will live an ordinary life. And all because I am stupid and lazy since childhood. I hate myself. I'd rather not be born. No one can even help, neither psychologists, nor my mother, and of course I myself.",

But no one has ever written just like that, for no reason. Didn't ask about my problems or how I was doing in life. All our conversations are superficial. I am sure that if I am gone, no one will grieve or suffer, because for everyone I am a ""convenient friend"". I know my shortcomings, which are destroying me and my nervous system: I take everything too close to my heart and it is very difficult to let people go from my life. As for my aunt, I'm not worried. She has a beloved grandson who completely outshines me. I very often think about how I would live if my mother were alive and I knew that in this world there is at least one person who really loves me. I do not mind letting new people into my life, but no one can replace the closest girl I have known since childhood and whom I consider my sister. But, unfortunately, she often does not take me and my requests seriously. The only thing that, so far, stops me from doing this is faith. I believe that suicides go to hell.

1,"I decided to write my own story, maybe someone's opinion will become a support for me. I want to live and always wanted to, even when I realized that the only way out of my impasse is suicide. So it turned out that I have a psychotic disease, sluggish schizophrenia. It is hereditary. It is difficult to live with this. I am not to blame for my illness, I did not choose it, I did not do something bad, and I did not ask me to give birth. But I was born with this. Since childhood I had isolation and psychological problems. In a family, naturally They didn’t love me for this, I’m like a burden for them. I often heard from my parents that it’s bad that doctors cannot determine such a disease during pregnancy, so they would have done an abortion. If from childhood I had been told that I’m sick in the head, they would have passed me to a special school, made a group, it would be easier. This was not deprived of me. And so I was not normal trying to live in peace with normal people. I went to an ordinary school where everyone bullied me, tried to make friends, guys that ended in vain. After graduation. school decided to look for a way out, change myself, improve, try to live normally like everyone else. I still did not understand that schizophrenia is a dead end from which there is no way out, you can only accept this, no matter how hard it is. I entered a technical school, graduated from it, there was a belief in myself that you can live a normal life. I got a job, began to earn money that I never had. There was not enough family for a normal life, and now difficulties appeared here, men either mocked me, or just threw when they noticed my psycho problems or when I myself confessed to them about it. And at the age of 25 I met the only person who accepted me. Who told me that the patient did not consider me. That this is just a diagnosis that does not scare him. I believed into myself, into life. In the fact that everything will work out. That here he is a way out of the impasse - work, for courage, family. And I am normal, I live like everyone else. But it did not take off. Joy did not last long. He turned out to be a former drug user, patients with hepatitis and HIV infection. Moreover, I knew about my diagnoses, I was registered. So, I confessed about my illness and he didn’t. I confessed already when I was asleep with me and when I began to guess. After a while, HIV was found in me. and that's all. And here hell began. I ended up in the hospital, lay there for a long time, during this time they found another person in my place. Depression began. Gradually my health began to fade away, after two years therapy was prescribed. So, trying to get out of the dead end, I drove myself into one more. And everything and there is no way out, only humility. And there is no life, there is only illness, lack of money, pain and loneliness. With my parents I had constant conflicts due to the fact that I ""sit on my neck"", screaming do yourself a disability. And if I I will try to do it, they will stop giving me drugs for HIV, since we do not treat HIV for mental illness, and I just need to watch me slowly die in agony. I am tired of everyday physical and psychological torment. I don’t know how and for what to live. I try to come to terms with everything, but inside it’s pain that nobody needs me here in this world, that there’s no way out. And there is no normal life",

I am tall (= 180 cm), many consider me too thin (57 kg without any diets, just because of post-stress). I don't like my non-Russian appearance. I have a big Bulgarian nose, ugly eyes, and for some reason I was born with very pale skin. I am sometimes mistaken for either Turkish or Gypsy. I don't like my figure. I hate everything about myself !! Your voice .. the manner of communicating with people (because I am not too complex), the manner of dressing, my green-brown eyes, hair color. I have a feeling that I was born in the wrong body, because I constantly feel myself uncomfortable in it, uncomfortable. It would seem that you were not born beautiful, but born happy. Yeah, happy ... You can write a separate story on this topic. In short: there are no friends (I have difficulty communicating with people, it morally exhausts me), there is no prosperous family, no money .... even there is no happiness in my soul. I want to kill myself because of my appearance. Whoever told me that appearance is not the main thing, the main thing is brains, I still continue to see my ugly face in the mirror ... yes, I want to change ... but solving this problem requires a huge amount of money (for plastic surgeries and etc.). I will earn them in 10 years ... and that's not a fact. I am so notorious that I made a promise to myself that I would not enter into a relationship with the opposite sex until I considered myself a beauty.

I left after the 9th grade of school, went to college, but due to my youthful stupidity, I dropped out of school at the age of 17, then worked, through an acquaintance, then a security guard (by the way, I was not in the army), then I sat at home. And so on until the age of 21, until through a friend I got a good job at a computer company. After a long and difficult internship, everything went well there, I worked well and earned money, there were often corporate parties on the occasion of big profits, I lived in pleasure. After about 4 years, the company gradually fell apart and as a result, in 2015 I lost my job. For 7 months I was again plunged into depression and sat at home without a penny and was looking for a job. In January 2016, I got a job in my city at the point of issue of one large online store, I worked there for 8 months, because working conditions were hellish, every day it was necessary to unload a large car and carry a large and not very good product on the stairs to the 2nd floor, but for me it was very difficult because I'm full. Since then, about 6 months have passed. I was desperate, I don't know what to do, how to find myself, what to do in the future, I understand that I have lost my life and time, at 25 I have a 9th grade education, I weigh more than 100 kilograms, the girl was last in 2013, when they parted, I ran out of all the money, only a piggy bank with a change remained, I am ashamed to sit on the neck of a mother who receives 20 thousand, when I am a healthy 25-year-old man, and who has her own problems, I am ashamed even to go out with friends like going out for a snack or watching a movie, because I don't even have normal clothes. My life is just as insignificant as I am, every day I look out the window and see there happy people who walk, drive their cars, strive for something and achieve. But not me, I do not see the point of how I can continue to live like this, I just do not leave the house for weeks, but there is still hell here for me. At the same time, I just don't have enough willpower to get up and start doing something. Why does this world need such weak-willed and insignificant people like me? I just do not see why and why I exist here. Maybe in the next life, if it exists, I will succeed. Here is such a pathetic story for me, at 25 I have literally nothing ... at least if you have read this pathetic scribble before here, I say thank you.",

1,"I don’t want to live in this cruel world with cruel people who are only happy to do nasty things to others instead of kindness, and moreover enjoy when others feel bad. plus stomach problems, just ate something wrong, everything turns out so that it's a nightmare. it hinders very much in modern life",
1,"Well, in general, I understand everything. And yet I just can't figure out ... when did it all go wrong. How could you ruin everything like that ?! I'm a girl, I'm 23. At 18 I fell in love. She dropped out of school because of him, although she studied on a budget, moved out of my mother at the moment when she gave birth, and her stepfather left her, we rented a house together, left alone with a baby in her arms, she left for the village to look after her sick grandmother , she could no longer rent a house herself. She was torn between the garden, her grandmother and the child, having an income that did not cover all her expenses, she rushed about as best she could, I knew this, sometimes sent her money, but mostly spent on entertainment and maintenance of her boyfriend. Well at least I'm working, he's not. The first beatings began out of jealousy. Everyone knows how it happens. Six months later, six months later I returned and everything was new. Fists in the face. Now I am lying next to him, looking at him and I do not believe that he can do that. A year later she left again, after a couple of months she returned. Two concussions. Suicide attempts. And again I am with him. Why? I hate him so much sometimes. And then I love it so much. When he is a normal, perfectly adequate person, so nice and sweet. But this is for the time being, he does not work, he sits at home all day and smokes, and I go to work, to the store for him. In fact, we are such strangers to each other, although we have already become like relatives, only this thought stops me. I want to leave every day. I cry every day. I haven’t seen my relatives for a year, I don’t communicate with anyone, not that he forbids, but simply when I start communicating, something happens to him, and I am always guilty and I get it again. If you pissed him off, even some bullshit might get you full. And insults every day. Why can't I leave? More precisely, she left many times, but always returned. And yesterday I was crying, I decided to leave, but I couldn't, I love it and that's it. And again I went to him .. I haven't talked to my mother at all for six months! I weigh 47 kg with an increase of 173, nervous work in the accounting department and all these thoughts simply do not fit in my head. How to break everything? And put your life in order?",

Vkontakte network and began to say that he is the administrator of a group in which prostitutes and links to their pages are posted. He said that if I throw him a photo in a bra, he will take it away in May. I cried for a long time, but still took it off He said that he removed it, but if I don’t throw off a photo of him by lifting his shirt, he will return it. I threw it. And now, a week later, my friend writes to me and says that today at 14:00 he will throw these photos into my class's conversation. I am now sitting and thinking about suicide. I don't know what else to do, but if my parents find out about it. So I sit and wait for him to throw off my photos and everyone will know about it. They will start to call it a teenage whore, etc. I am very scared, and I have the feeling that I will definitely do something to myself. I'm very scared & # 128557;",

1,"I am in 7th grade. I live in Novosibirsk. I'm creepy. I have 2-3 friends and I have become different. Because of this, at school, those who are older than me laugh and make fun of me all the time. Some make fun of my fans asking for pictures or murals, and then laugh at me and scoff. Some make fun of what they supposedly love. In one of those who make fun of me that I love he fell in love with me 2 years older. Once in VKontakte, he wrote to me that he liked me and offered to meet, I agreed, and told me that I loved him for a long time. Then they told me that it was a joke and half of the school laughed at me. And I love him very much and now he probably won't communicate with me. I even want to commit suicide. What should I do?",

I have only one friend, and then we only see each other at school. I have never had a girlfriend, because I am ugly and shy. I have experienced major depression once in my life, so even the hair on my head is now a little gray. Apparently, it is overtaking again. I am a fat piece ... In this society, I will not be able to continue living normally, so I have long had a plan - to go to the forest and settle there alone.

And I myself do not believe in myself, because for me even life is a terrible torment. Frequent quarrels do not remain unnoticed not only in my soul, but also on my body.

1,"What's the point in living? I am 30 years old, I have nothing. neither husband, nor children, in our country, in general a woman is not a woman without these attributes. And most importantly, there is no normal work. I graduated from the university, studied to be a psychologist, because of a heap of fears and complexes I did not get a job, then I went to a trifling job on the phone, I worked without a TC. after 2.5 years fell into depression, 4 years !!!! did not work, it's scary to even remember how I could do that. As a result, my mother again got me to work, but part-time, it's a penny, no experience. The work is also not difficult. At the age of 30, I have no idea where to get a job with such luggage. I open websites with work and close them, I understand that I have nothing to look for. The future is in black, and so is the present. I do not see the meaning of my life, why I was born, so that I would only suffer and dishonor my family, with my stupidity and helplessness. everything is absolutely pointless. I can't get out of this quagmire of helplessness since childhood. They only criticized at home, so I hate myself. I see no way out. Why did I study, spend 5 years of my life, in order to eventually get a job somewhere in a call center in the left company and sit there for a penny. And what kind of pension awaits me in old age, poverty? About the establishment of my personal life I am generally silent, apparently this part of life is not intended for me. At least find a job while there is a mother, you can choose something, live at her expense, and then what? I sometimes think that I'd rather be hit by a car or killed by a tree than others, what's the point in me? in my opinion no. I know that this is all a sin, but it is not easier for me. I am 30 and I am an infantile girl with no future. Thank you for your attention, I will be glad to hear tips.",

My dad is an alcoholic, my mom is a hard worker, two sisters avoid me beyond recognition ... It happens very rarely they yell. But they often beat me with a stick, phone charger cords, and eat. But I endure it all ... I thought about suicide more than once or twice, probably more than 100 ... You ask why? Why do I want to die? Why am I still alive? Why do you get along with me like that? The answer is simple. They don't like me. In life, for parents and sisters, I ... I ... I don't even know who I am in their eyes ... I am a punching bag for them or I don’t know ... But I have such feelings that I was born in vain into this world ... I sleep on the floor every night. There is no bed for me at home. They forbid me to sleep in the hall sofa. I hide behind my father's old things. And it's all true ... Everything, everything. As I told me I am 11 and during these 11 years I have seen so much.

I am not interested in other people, I do not want to see them, communicate with them, they just annoy me. As for the relationship in terms of love, then everything is sad. It so happened that I was born of the wrong orientation and I understand that I am attracted not by people, but only by their genitals. For the last half of the year I have been simply rotting, I am not a bad student, but it is very difficult for me. I would like to find something to my liking, good people, a soul mate, but everything falls to hell, because I am just sick of all this. Every day I want to die more and more.

1,"I don’t know why I’m writing here at all, because I know in advance everything that you will tell me. Probably, I'm just a chmoshnik, who has no one and nowhere else to pour out his soul, except here. In general, it all started with my birth. I was born and everything went bad right away. My parents were not in my plans, they got married right away, when my mother was 17, and my father was 20. They naturally put all their energy on study and work to feed me, so little attention was paid to me personally. In principle, I'm not complaining, because I perfectly understand how hard it was for them. Well, when they received diplomas, rather prestigious jobs, they thought that I had already grown up, and I didn't need this attention at all. I also strained with friends, there was a childhood friend who, over time, showed me, they say, he had new friends (in connection with the transfer to another school) and he no longer needs me, he is not interested in me. All the rest can only be called acquaintances. There were, of course, attempts to make friends (by this word, I always meant not just people to drink and take a walk, these are people close to you in spirit, who understand you), but they were unsuccessful. It seems to me that the matter is in me, although I cannot explain it. Since the age of 13 I have been living on my own. I tried to look for a hobby, did a lot of things, but it's not that. At school, teachers always scoff at me in the sense that I slowly but surely do not use my ""potential"". The fact is that I treat my lessons very negligently, I go to school very rarely, but when I manage to give some answers in the lesson or hand over some work, the teachers seem to like them, and they say that they are like boiling brains, but I don't use them and sink my life to the bottom. Lol. I don't know why, but somehow I don't care. Really do not care. Maybe it’s because of eternal loneliness, because there is no close person nearby, I don’t feel my own importance. But for some reason I do not care about my fate, whether I am alive at all or die tomorrow. Thoughts about suicide creep in, but let's not talk about that. Selfharma is enough. And the joke is that I understand with my head, they say, dude, this is a little not normal, let's do something about it, decide. But I still don't care. It probably sounds strange. Guy, you write that you have problems, but you don’t care about them, why did you stick with it then, live on. It's just that deep inside I want to live an adequate life, you know, to finish school, to start a family, but at the same time I absolutely don't care what and how, I just sit and wait for death.",

Yes, I know, we need to change, but there is no strength at all. I started to get involved in sleeping pills and tranquilizers. Because of this, relations with parents deteriorated. They constantly yell and accuse me. They say they are tired of me. I'm tired myself. I'm tired of everything. In theory, in such cases, a change of scenery helps, but I have no desire for either strength or money. I don't want anything at all and I can't. I eat sleeping pills all day and go to work.

I'm afraid to be in public places, to contact people. This has been a real problem for me for a long time. I asked my mother to take me to a psychologist because it really bothered me a lot. After two sessions, I realized that I didn't want to walk anymore. I didn't want to talk to anyone and talk about my feelings. I stopped telling loved ones about my experiences and just closed my eyes. After a while, I noticed frequent irritability. Bright light, sounds of anything from a passing car to a banging of your foot. Everything infuriates me and I just want to run away, close and feel nothing. Now I feel nothing but this irritability and weakness. I don’t feel like doing anything, I’m lying on the bed and can’t do anything. I just lie there.",
1,"Nobody needs me! This thought has been spinning in my head for many years. I have never been pampered with much love. Mom simply did not know how to give it to us, she is from an orphanage, and dad is a dictator from a military family. My sister and I were punished for the slightest offense (they beat me and it happened brutally to the point of bleeding), my mother kept shouting that we were ugly creatures, that she didn't need such children. it happened once that my mother kicked me out of the house, I was 5 years old, she packed my backpack and put it out the door and didn't let me go home until my father came ... You are nothing! Rag! Monster! I don't need you! I heard these words constantly. Father is also not sugar when one day he came for me to the kindergarten to the words dad I love you and mom will cook dumplings today? He broke my nose ... He never defended me, although he constantly stood up for my sister. I, too, stood up for her, despite the fact that she constantly bullied me, then she locked one up in the room or in the closet, even on the balcony, left it at subzero temperatures overnight, then beat her to injury, then she could come up at night and start choking me with a pillow. I couldn't sleep well. I had nightmares all the time. In order to somehow hide from all this, I huddled in the farthest and darkest corner so that no one would find it. This habit has remained and to this day I want to run away to hide in a corner and so that no one touches. The older I got, the worse it got. When my classmates came to school, my classmates disliked me, and the persecution began as the dogs curled up and drove the game and they drove me. I told my parents about it many times but no one paid attention. I was thrown to figure out everything myself, no one needs me, and well, who could I ask for help. I had no peace anywhere, neither at school nor at home, I ran away into the forest away from people and kept asking God for what? I prayed for the forgiveness of my offenders. I didn't do anything wrong to anyone, but everyone hated me. I wanted to disappear, die, and once my body simply refused to work normally, then I was in the hospital for half a year, it was a respite for me, but then it all started from the beginning and the attacks were repeated again and again. Mom scolded me for this, and she has so many problems, and even I am here with my seizures, when I came home beaten, they scolded me for dirty clothes and did not even ask what happened. I am afraid of people, I am afraid to be alone in a room, I am afraid that I will be abandoned again, I am afraid to tell my mother about my problems, I have no one to tell how bad I am, no one will come to my aid, I do not need anyone",

She said that no one will love her anymore (Except me) and here on you, ""Guy"" appeared, you can say my friend. He offered her, but she turned him off too ... We continued to communicate in parallel. The friend's name was, well, let's say, Roman. And I began to notice how he took my best friend from me ... A few weeks later she left me.

A month and a half passed and today, by chance, seeing how the bride wrote to him from another country again asked everything. This time he answered me that everything was decided there and that it was not so easy to take and tell his parents that he already had a girlfriend with whom he wanted to be. He says that he loves me, but does nothing to meet me, does not speak to my parents, and I do not see life without him, I just sit and cry constantly.

1,"Всё плохо, просто плохо, хочу умереть… Я теперь понимаю все эти истории про суицидников, типо “госпади, как он мог такое с собой сделать, вроде бы из нормальной, благополучной, полноценной семьи, хорошее воспитание и т.п, поверить не могу…” ну и в этом роде. Никто, абсолютно никто кроме меня не знает что происходит у меня в голове, я никому не рассказывал, хотя понимаю что надо… А кому высказаться ? У меня нет настоящих друзей, вообще нет, понимаете, а завести их я не смогу, так как я замкнутый в себе, закомплекованный, асоциальный, депрессивный нытик и лютый пессимист, и исправить это не получится, так как это всё у меня с очень раннего детства, почти всю жизнь со мной всё это… Я не умею нормально общаться с людьми, для меня это сильный стресс, волнение, боязнь сказать что-то не так, забыть что-то сказать, допустить какую-то ошибку, выглядеть глупо, но, собственно, всё это и случается в процессе общения… Да и друг для меня, это тот человек, с которым приятно и легко общаться на любые темы, с которым интересно и весело, который может поддержать в трудную минуту, как-то успокоить, что-то посоветовать, этот человек максимально честен и откровенен со мной, и я в свою очередь тоже максимально открыт и честен с этим человеком и готов искренне поддержать его и в радости и в горе. Я называю таких друзей “настоящими”, кто-то называет таких друзей “лучшими”, но у меня нет такого разделения на “лучших” и простых друзей, или какой-либо иной иерархии друзей, у меня есть такие понятия как “настоящие” друзья, и просто “знакомые”. Знакомые это те люди, чьи имена я знаю, с кем здороваюсь, могу пообщаться иногда и всё. А таких друзей ещё поискать надо… С друзьями понятно, следующий вариант – родители. Я не хочу с ними об этом говорить, и всё. Они поймут, выслушают, я знаю, но они ничем не помогут, я знаю, что каждый из них скажет… Да и грузить их не очень хочется, так как у меня есть младший брат, у которого проблемы с весом и с речью, и родители полностью отдаются ему, и я не против, я не считаю в этом плане себя обделённым вниманием, я всё понимаю, хочу как лучше, не буду я их лишний раз напрягать. Есть ещё вариант психолог. Но как вы понимаете, незаметно сходить к психологу, на несколько сеансов, оставить там кучу денег, и купить кучу таблеток которые он пропишет, сделать всё это незаметно не получится, всё это обнаружат родители… Да и я догадываюсь, что психолог скажет. Эти до боли примитивные советы и пожелания, всё это предсказуемо… Так что не вариант это. Вот и всё. Поэтому я держу всё это в себе… Я не знаю как это объяснить, это не то чтобы боль, некая тяжесть внутри, сгусток чего-то тяжёлого, негативного, чёрного, мрачного, злого во мне, и это всё сидит во мне, очень глубоко, и как опухоль разрастается всё больше и больше… Постоянно где-то что-то болит, везде какой-то дискомфорт, постоянно что-то мешает, раздражает, как только появляются негативные мысли (а это практически круглосуточно), подступает ком к горлу, стискиваю зубы, сжимаю кулаки, зажмуриваю глаза, терплю, чтобы не зареветь как баба, держу слёзы в себе до последнего, и всё равно пускаю ручьи по щекам, и в итоге рыдаю где-нибудь в укромном месте… Не люблю выходить на улицу, там люди, много людей, я стараюсь их избегать, избегать их насмешек, оскорблений, презрительных и высокомерных взглядов… Постоянная сонливость и зевота из-за бессонницы, слабость и вялость из-за плохого и неправильного питания и режима дня мешают учиться…   Думаю надо пояснить из-за чего всё это, что за комплексы. Комплексов 3. Это по поводу очков, по поводу прыщей, и по поводу худобы. Можете сказать, что от моих комплексов легко избавиться, устранив их основы по факту. Я думал об этом, это возможно, но это не вариант в моём случае… Я просто скажу, что чтобы мне избавится от прыщей, от следов после прыщей, вылечить мою проблемную кожу, сделать лазерную корректировку зрения и “накачаться” (добрать хотя бы до нормы, предварительно вылечив проблемный ЖКТ), мне понадобиться примерно 150000 рублей и год времени. Денег мне этих никто не даст, а чтобы мне с моей учёбой и постоянными болезнями заработать их, подрабатывая где-то раз в 2-3 месяца, получая по 5-7 тысяч рублей, при этом я ещё плачу за интернет дома и на телефоне, сам себя одеваю и снабжаю всем необходимым по учёбе… Представьте, сколько времени мне нужно, чтобы накопить эти деньги, которые всё решат. Даже если я их накоплю за 3-4 года, я потрачу на накопление всю эту драгоценную молодость, полную энергии, желаний и возможностей, и ещё мне год нужен чтобы всё осуществить… Вот так. И что делать ? Как жить ? А вообще стоит ли жить ? Но и самоубийство в моём случае не выход… У меня в семье есть человек, ивалид, который в молодости пытался свести счёты с жизнью, он многое пережил в своей жизни, и этот человек мне очень дорог, я не могу так его подвести, он этого не переживёт… Это всё, что меня сдерживает. (но этот человек меня не поймёт сейчас, и даст примитивные советы, так что поговорить с ним на эту тему – не вариант, да и “соль на рану” ему). Вот как-то так. Пожизненное смирение ? У меня уже крыша едет, всё хуже и хуже моё психическое состояние… Вот это безысходность, просто жесть… Мне кажется, нет, я даже уверен, что я рано или поздно сорвусь… Либо сопьюсь, либо убьюсь, не знаю, но точно один из этих вариантов случиться… Вопрос только, на сколько меня хватит ? Вот этого я не знаю… Сопьюсь, если начну заглушать всю эту боль алкоголем. Курение с алкоголем как антидепрессант подтянется, это дело времени, а там и до наркотиков не далеко… Покончу с собой, если буду всё это держать и переваривать в себе, на трезвую голову, это ещё тяжелее и больнее, всё время в размышлениях и в напряжении… Раньше затыкал уши наушниками, включал музыку погромче, или там, смотрел видео смешные, мемы, и как-то чуть легче на миг становилось, а теперь и это не помогает… Да, счастье для меня – это общение, внимание… Ну, это пока что. Ну мало ли, я получу это счастье, и разочаруюсь в нём, и перестанет это быть для меня счастьем и смыслом жизни… Тогда уже кто знает.Я не могу так жить, серьёзно, мне 18 лет, я завидую чёрной завистью тем, кто уже с 14-16 лет курит, бухает, ходит по клубам, ездит на вписки, да да я завидую всем им, я хочу так жить, пока я молодой ! А ведь молодость проходит, скоро уже 20 лет, а я ни разу не пил, не курил, девственник, даже ни разу не было девушки, ни разу не целовался, ни разу не ходил на свидания… Боже, как же я всё это хочу… Да ладно это всё, мне бы элементарно, хотя бы пару-тройку настоящих друзей, да хотя бы одного, настоящего, лучшего друга, девушку, не супер модель, не идеальную, обычную. Чтобы было с кем поговорить, чтобы я был нужен, по-настоящему нужен… Мне много не надо для того чтобы появился хоть какой-то смысл в моём жалком существовании… Не могу больше терпеть это, хочу жить нормальной жизнью, но не судьба… На сколько меня хватит, не знаю… Я не могу так жить, но и умереть не могу, и изменить ничего не смогу… Я слишком рано повзрослел и прохавал все “прелести” жизни. Я разочаровался в дружбе, в любви, в людях, в обществе, в религии, в целом в жизни, ещё в раннем детстве. Интересно получается, мы познаём жизнь, знакомимся с этим жестоким миром, допускаем ошибки, “обжигаемся”, в детстве, когда мы психически ещё очень слабы. Это нам, людям свойственно, учиться на своих ошибках, наступать на грабли… Но если ты человек слишком добрый, слишком наивный, слишком доверчивый, слишком мечтательный, слишком ранимый, вообщем, такой как я, то эта жизнь тебя сломает, и сделает это не в равной борьбе, а когда ты ещё слабый и неокрепший ни телом, ни духом ребёнок… Всё идёт из детства… Я постоянно держал все свои загоны, переживания, вопросы, всё это в себе, внутри переваривал, ни с кем не делился и никому не высказывался… Я просто не хотел грузить своими проблемами и переживаниями родителей, да и вообще любых других людей, мне даже возможно было стыдно за свои проблемы и вопросы, которые у меня возникали, и ещё и поэтому я ими не делился ни с кем. А кто в этом виноват ? Да никто. Я был маленьким, неопытным, да просто ребёнком, я хотел как лучше, чтобы родителям и обществу было со мной легче, я никого не грузил и никому не высказывался, а родители, да они и не подозревали, что у меня какие-то проблемы и загоны, я же им ничего не говорил, а они не экстрасенсы… Они считали что если бы я был чем-то обеспокоен, я бы сказал об этом… Но нет, я держал всё в себе… Никто, кроме меня не виноват в том, что со мной сейчас происходит. Я понимаю, что есть люди, которым намного хуже, чем мне, я их понимаю и сочувствую им, но мне от этого не легче… Живу я только в мечтах, в вымышленной реальности, которую я сам себе придумал, там хорошо, но я не смогу там жить вечно… Читаю книги, не пью, не курю, не употребляю наркотики, не хожу по клубам, не езжу на вписки, не играю в компьютерные игры… А кому-то это интересно ? Я такой кому-то нужен ? Да, да, родителям, и всё ? Кроме семьи никому. Я не в обществе, я отдельно. И всем плевать. Вот что мне делать ? М ? Безвыходных ситуаций не бывает ? Ха, ну ну… Ни умереть, ни исправить ситуацию, ни смириться, ни-че-го не могу сделать… Жалкий, беспомощный, ноющий, плывущий по течению… Вот кто я… Вопрос времени, на сколько меня хватит, вот и всё… ",
1,". I think I need help. I see no reason to live. So I study at school, so that later I can find a good job and live in abundance, and then die. Is that all? Is this all we live for? But if you look at this from the side of biology, people themselves complicate their lives, limit it to the framework of norms and morality, but what is morality? This is a cage in which everyone must imprison themselves, so that they are not condemned by millions of identical copies, so as not to be a black sheep. But, in spite of my dissatisfaction, I cannot neglect these rules, because I live in a society in which I do not want to live. I just wonder why I was not born some kind of animal? What good is I being human? What is good about consciousness and thinking? They only lead to destruction. Look at what people have done and continue to do with our planet. Really, the meaning of our existence is to spoil something, to destroy something? Something got me carried away. I hate myself for not being able to express my thoughts correctly. I just want to go to another planet, but because it is impossible, then the only way out remains - death. I don't see the point in my existence. I try to be kind to everyone, in public I try to smile and joke, but every day it becomes more difficult. It’s as if I’m empty, I don’t feel anything: I don’t want to cry, I don’t want to scream. But this has gone too far, so I am writing here, maybe it will be possible to get out of this swamp. I have no friends, my sister and I no longer have common topics for conversation, my parents do not understand at all, they condemn my every action, everything is bad at school, I’m a dumbass, the same with beauty, and lately I don’t want to do anything but die. Last year, at least something interested, but now nothing. Everything that brought joy only agitates, everything that aroused interest is tired, and people are not interesting to me at all. I just dream of dying from some kind of illness, when my stomach hurts in my left side, I imagine myself that there is appendicitis and I expect to die in a few days. And if I do not manage to die of illness, I pray to get to the psychiatric hospital, it will be calmer for me, because there are people who understand me (patients and psychologists) and there is not all this gray life that I have now. Maybe it's not normal, but I love it when my temperature rises, especially under 40, when everything around is so unreal and I can hardly stand on my feet, and it's dizziness and darker in my eyes - I like it all, and I think that if there is problems with the psyche, then there will be the same sensations, only the outcome is not always fatal, which cannot but rejoice, because this sensation will last a lifetime. And I was carried away again. Well. Tell me the meaning of life or give me advice on how to go crazy.",

In the decree, at the request of her husband, she went to study in another specialty, which is fundamentally different from what she knew and did before. In general, he paid for tuition and then a divorce and the last course of training in care at the academy because there is no money for training.

1,"My name is Vova. I'm 14. I don't want to live. Dad doesn't like me, he often swings and constantly yells obscenities at me on all occasions. He is not a drinker, but from what such aggression I do not understand. Mom treats me like some kind of robot. Sometimes it seems to me that she never thinks what to me. She makes you constantly sit at textbooks, learn lessons that are not even given. You see, I have to be smart. When I asked her about this, she said in a loud and rough voice: Why why? Guess. Due to the fact that I am forcibly persecuted for textbooks, I don't even have time to walk or sit for an hour on the phone. Rarely can I surf the Internet. But a month ago I thought she was showing love that way. I ordered a present for her to make her happy. A magnetic poster on which pleasant words were written and family photos were posted. But after 4 days the magnet was not on the refrigerator. I asked my mother where is he? She said she didn't know. Maybe my brother took it. But when I went to the store, a torn magnet was lying on the street near the trash heap. I almost shed a tear. I was not home 4 hours after I was sent to the store. For the evening I came and just sent my dad when he asked where I was. I went to bed and my temperature rose. I'm at home with my grandmother. I had thoughts of suicide, but I did not dare. I can't live like this anymore. What should I do, who can give advice?",

I ask you not to throw me there for a scientific atheist with experience. Although a former Orthodox Christian, I even had a spiritual father at one time.",
1,"Sounds crazy to a believer, I understand. Every day I ask God to take me to him, I myself have a small guts to do this is a big sin. I'm tired of my life, I DO NOT NEED ANYONE. I AM ZERO, I LIKE DO NOT EXIST, I am worthless and do not benefit anyone. All my life everyone has been spreading rot since school, starting from the 9th grade, they insulted that terrible, that one not beautiful girl in the class is more beautiful than me. I come from a poor family dressed badly at me they laughed at. The father is a drunkard scandals all his life, beat my mother, at the age of 19 she got married and gave birth to a daughter, my husband humiliated me when 2 years old my daughter was forced to go to work, I worked as a nanny in the garden and a salesman, he did not provide me, there were scandals, he also called me wide , although I weighed 48 kg after giving birth, when my daughter was 3 years old, I went to my parents, filed for alimony and divorced (I don’t regret it at all), many years have passed I am now 32 years old, I AM ONE, I don’t like ANYONE at all, somewhere before 28 years there was just a one-time relationship, but I was only used now for 4 years, the man did not touch me at all, they constantly pull me up for my appearance all my life, then I am a curve, then some other, why should I live at all? Why alone, they constantly spread rot everywhere and at work, they overwhelmed me with work and salary least of all, but I can't have a daughter without work, and I'm alone, when men find out about a divorce they constantly pull up, why they divorced, and feel sorry for their ex-husband without knowing the situation ... What should I do? I can't watch how guys really love girls and kill for them, and no one has ever loved me, they just used me, and now when I don't live in fornication for so many years, as soon as they find out that I will not sleep, they immediately leave. I still have a problem, I have subcutaneous acne, strong, after one drug that the doctor prescribed to me to drink. it's just awful, how can I live like that at 32? Now I am being treated a lot of drugs, I buy, it got better, but still the skin is bad, a guy wanted to come up to me, and I left because of acne, now he mocks me, calls me names that the curve, on the other hand, walks past me. I am TIRED of human bullying, I will just commit suicide, help me, I just have no way out. Also, I go to church and confess and receive communion, NOTHING helps me. One priest did not even believe that I had no one. But it's true.",
1,"! My name is Anya. And I'm 12 years old. I'm tired of living ... I just don't need anyone in this world. I'm fat, not beautiful, I can’t do anything. I don’t draw, nor sing, nor dance, nor swim, absolutely nothing. ... In the classroom, all the girls have such thin legs and arms, and I am a boar ... parents are constantly yelling when I ask my mother something, she just says ""Go away, don't bother me"", when dad has, he with screams and a psycho, somehow helps with lessons. I also hate my younger sister. She is 3 years old, she constantly yells, howls, fights, bites. It pisses me off. Even though I was in the other room, it's my fault that Liza fell from the couch, although my mother was there and was sitting at the computer. I tried to lose weight, but my mother says that there is no money for a diet, for sports clubs too. In general, I eat only dumplings and pasta, sausage and bread. On the other, as my mother says money no. I have health problems, just a huge number of diseases. I am a walking problem for my family. I cry at night. At school I can hardly restrain myself so as not to cry. I can’t, I can’t do it and by the way height 159cm weight 54 kg.",
1,"I can’t continue to live like this, for many years I tried to maintain positive thinking, but I no longer have the strength. I am a chronic loser and cannot do anything about it, I tried with all my might to change the situation, made plans for the future, but poverty and stupidity ruined me. Constant suicidal thoughts haunt me",
1,"I don't know where to put myself. I dated a man for 6 years. I just breathed it. 2 times at the beginning we parted, the first 3 years are generally difficult to call a relationship, after that I forgave the betrayal. I fought, endured, changed, sagged, flowed, came back when he wanted to resume everything, I did everything to preserve the relationship, make it better, denied myself any interests and needs. Our last 2 years have been ideal for me, because I have achieved what I wanted, I have never had such harmony and peace before. And so he got a job, works like a horse, no normal person can plow like that. His roof went completely, he pushed me away, did not want to talk, did not explain the reasons until the moment when HIS passion called me. Only then did he pull himself together and tell me everything. He said that he only loved the first 2 years, that it was not you, but me. That he doesn't need anything from life (this is so) that I will never understand his work. I have never felt so bad as now. My parents left, my only friend lives far away, and the rest are his friends, whom I do not want to see just so as not to think. It's hard for me to live even on the same street with him. Seeing his car, in the end I can't even sleep in my bed because I always shared it. I have always been afraid of suicidal thoughts, I am afraid of that. But I just want to take it and disappear. I understand that life goes on, and as many say, young, you will find another, and this goat. Even so, at the moment I am so devastated and shocked that I’m even afraid to imagine a different relationship in the first place, and secondly, no matter how I curse him for everything, I still love you can’t do anything about it. I cry all day, climb on the wall alone in the apartment, I don't want to go anywhere. I go to work and cry there, no matter how hard I try and try to distract myself, what pills I just don't drink. And the further, the more medicine I try to push into myself. Maybe someone thinks such a simple parting is not a problem (sometimes I myself catch myself thinking that this is stupid) but I can no longer, as if my soul was sucked. I am such a person, this cannot be changed unfortunately, I can still reason soberly sometimes. What to do at the moment, when everything reminds me, when you close your eyes and see this disgusting sick picture, which stands as a wall. As soon as I did not try to reconfigure myself, and I all understand that someday everything will work out and so on. At the moment, forgive me for the expression, I just want to die, so as not to suffer, so that it all ends finally, all this pain and what is eating inside. I swallow a bunch of pills, which do not help, but in large quantities. I can’t refrain from accepting either, because I literally sit on the floor every day and bang against the wall. I only regret my parents, I don’t want to hurt them, but I myself can’t do it either.",

1,"Здравствуйте.Захожу на этот сайт частенько,читаю просьбы и понимаю многих людей.Сегодня решил написать сам,незнаю зачем,но в надежде о помощи.Кому то может знакомо эта ситуация,и подскажет как с неё выбраться.В данный момент жизни испытываю пустоту,бещпомощьнось,аппатию,зависть,и жалость и злость на себя.Это делать нельзя,да я знаю. Я постараюсь донести свои мысли,убеждение.Не судите строго,это все на эмоциях.Начну с того что 7 месяцев назад полностью поменялось мировоззрение.Была психологическая травма-это потеря любимого человека.Я открыл свою душу ей,хотя и сам незнал что там творится.И тут понеслось.Переосмысливание всей жизни.Тогда только открылись глаза на это суровый мир.Дело в том что я не жил реальностью,жил в своем мирку много мечтал,чувствовал себя там безопасно.А когда открыл глаза стало очень страшно,как будто я один против целого мира.Выяснив это начал читать информацию в интернете.Все это началось с детсва,родители мои не развивались.Жили неблагополучно.Нас 7детей.Матались по квартирам,отец много пил и бил мать.Работал на стройках ни к чему не стремился.Мать в своем роде тоже человек без цели.Наклепали детей,а справиться не смогли.Тем самым с раниго детсва и пошли убеждения что я ни достоин лучшего,ни уважения ни любви. За мной не следили,не учили самостоятельности,не воспитывали вообще.Таким забитым и пошел в школу.Не ряшлив,наивный и глупый.Соответсвенно был жалкий,и был изгоем.В старших классах тоже самое,из за низкой самооценки был жалким.Для авторитета стал курить и прогуливать.Для своих желаний,и потребности воровал и подрабатывал на грязных работах.Друзья были при чем очень много,так как в детстве интересовался очень многим,от спорта,до творчества.Поступил после 9 в ПТУ на слесаря,так как ни финансово ни морально не потянул бы.Там тоже не гладко все,считали жалким.Так как я к тому же молчун.Боязнь сказать что то глупое.Много прогуливал,чтоб тоже казаться авторитетом среди одногруппников.Употреблял легкие наркотики в тех же целях.С раних лет боялся одиночества,и стремился быть любимым,мечтал иметь девушку.Но правда с этим было трудно,кто мне нравился,считали меня просто другом.Приходилось встречаться с теми кому нравился я.Страх сделать первые шаги,общение с ними.Эта неуверенность.После училища сразу же забрали в армию.Я даже толком и не понимал куда иду.В итоге это мое первое испытание жизни.В далеке от дома,неувереность и низкая самооценка не покидала.Много унижали,но не трогали из за жалости.Во второй половине службы накинули лычки.Ответсвеность,с самооценка возвысилась,но толку от это не было.Так как я очень добрый человек,к тому же слабак нормальным командиром не был .Так же везде присутствувала эта без помощьность.Во вемя дембеля я даже сам домой приехать не смог,просил сослуживцев по пути до бросить.Окощавшись дома.Погуляв неделю,отец забрал на стройку пахать на семью,как должное.Работал с ним,он мне не доверял ответсвенную работу ,тем самым работал подсобником.Местами где то что то научился,и работал сам.Вечерами проводил время с кружками попиваю пива и ходить по кабакам.Встречался с доступными девушками привлекая их своей добротой и доверчивость.Зачастую я уходил от них так как чувствовал что не мое либо не достоин даже их,искал что то лучше.С родными никогда не знакомились,так как я их призирали,точнее не долюблтвае.За их не ряшливость и ответсвеность за жизнь.Так шло время,грязная тупая работа,выпивки,гулянье поиски любимой девушки лижбы не быть одиноким.Знакомился только в чатах,так как боялся,точнее был не уверен подойти до девушек в живую.Однажды познакомился с девушкой.Мы долго с ней дружили.Она приехала к нам в небольшой городок работать по профессии.Она мне очень нравилась и я пытался добиться ее внимания,но из за этой неуверенности и жалости и страха тяжело получалось.Уделяя ей очень много времени мне это получилось сделать.Начали встречаться,я был по уши влюблен в нее ,точнее зависим.Она меня вдохновила,у меня поднялась самооценка,и появилась радость.Я стал стремятся для нее быть лучше.Уехав в командировки с отцом ,за короткий срок заработал 300 тысяч на автомобиль,познакомил ее с родителями.Они были рады,да и я к ним начал с любовью относиться.Но вдохновения не так долго длилось,до первой ревности.Она общительный,но в то же время очень наивный человек.Я постоянно боялся ее потерять,запрещял ей ходить с подругами по кафе,и сидеть в чатах.Пытался подстроить под себя и в то же время понимал что это невозможно.Я работал на стройках и жил не богато,да и бывало что месецами дома сидел.У меня было такое чувство что она меня тянет,и требует с меня то что я дать не могу.Это наверное из за моей никчемности.Шло время,были соры были и счастливые моменты.Она не могла иметь детей,но в тоже время стремилась поправить свое здоровье,я же наоборот говорил хочу их,но в душе не хотел,потому что был не уверен в себе,то что справлюсь,то что не хочу на свет подобия себя,такого же жалкого.Однажды она уехала к матери в гости,за сотни километров от меня.Я же не поехав с ней,не хотел знакомиться с родителями,откладывал все на потом.Еще и средств не было на поездку.Отпустил ситуации,доверился ей.Спустя несколько дней опять сора.Через неделю она мне звонит и говорит что не любит меня и изменила мне .У меня тяжелый стресс.Я не верил этому.проходит еще несколько дней и говорит что она выходит за муж,обвеняя меня в этом,то что я сам добился этого то что я ни развиваюсь,то что я трус,никчемный не достойный.Я ее слова принял близко к сердцу,меня она ими убила.Звонила она каждый день так как не отпускала,при этом живя с будущим мужем.Я же,так как боялся остаться один,брал трубку и общялся с ней.Начатался в форумах действия при возврате девушек и подорожал этому.Начало вроде получаться.Но обвал,она выходит замуж.Слезы у меня стресс.алкоголем глушил все.Хотел ехать и забрать ее но многие останавливали,да и сам маялся.И так продолжалось еще месяц постоянный звонки по телефону,ее слова что сделала ошибку ,что не хочет быть с ним.А свадьба это родителей так пожалела.Еще через месяц мы с ней встретились,и договорились быть вместе.Но уехав она опять обманула.Я ей не звонил с момента измены,постоянно выходила она на связь,так как я слабый но все таки держу себя и не подаю виду.И так продолжалось еще месяц,пока она окончательно перестала писать.Я много думал в течении всех этих месяцев,и решил менять свою жизнь.Через друзей устроился на работу,автоюрист.Бросил пить и курить,больше общался с людьми , в общем пошел против себя,своих страхов.Но это длилось не долго.Как то вечером она прислала СМС что беременна,и изменялась.Я сорвался,начал пить,лишился работы,соответсвенно и друзей.Лишился прав,чтобы отдать долги пришлось продать авто за копейки.Началь еще сильнее депрессия,все отвернулись,так как я им уже надоел своим нытьем о неудачной жизни.Психологии выманивают деньги,а толку нету.Интересса нету ни к чему.Вроде бы все конец,живу как овощь .Но проходит пару недель и эта девушка приезжает к нам в город в гости до подруг.Нашла меня,опять боль.Мы провили время вмести,она умоляла простить и очень хотела вернуться,в тоже время боялась мести.Я ее простил,с горем со слезами отправил обратно к матери,хоть и жалею.Я ее люблю сильно,но не могу в душе простить той боли,тех долгих мук.Я разрываюсь на части.Мы общяемся с ней,но я ее отдоляя от себя потихоньку,в тоже время ненавидя себя за это.За эти пол года очень сильно потерялась память,нервы пошатнулась.Сейчас работаю так же на стройке обычным подсобнок,и через знакомых устроился установщиком топливного оборудования ли ж бы выжить.Живу с родителями в одном дворе.Так же испытываю муки с ними.У меня небольшой дом,который построил мой брат до своей свадьбы,он остался мне так как он съехал.Сейчас после развода с женой,он живет со мной очень много пьет,не ряшлив ни к чему не стремиться.Так же вернулась младшая сестра беременная с мужем,итого нас в нашем дворе живет восемь человек.Ни кто из них не ухаживает за собой,ни к чему не стремиться,просто деградируют.Не убирают за собой,постоянная грязь.Разговоры не помогают.Я бы уехал,но куда?кто меня ждет.В нашем мире на каждом шагу кинуть могут.Да и старых родителей жалко,пусть я их не долюбливаю,но их я не брошу.А оставить их сестре или брату на присмотр,думаю врятли они кружку с водой поднесут.Вот так вот я живу и мучаюсь ,точнее существую.Больше всех я не долюбливаю мать-то что родила.Это не правильно,но установка у меня в голове.Я борюсь с собой,читаю что то где то как изменится.У меня огромное желание,но сил уже не хватает.Я себя чувствую овощем.Который не может исправиться.Ни чего ни хочу,просто пустота,я незнаю как жить теперь.Во всем виноват сам!!!! Вкус жизни пропал.Много завидую людям,которые состоялись.Друзей уже нету.Они строят свои семьи,да и зачем я им,унылый меланхолик.Новоя работа,не вызывает интереса,да что то там говорить я не умею общаться с людьми,смотреть им в глаза.Страх,и не понимая.Я элементарных вещей даже не понимаю,чувствую себя ничтожным и тупым.Хоби нету,да и не тянит ни к чему.Спорт?качалка,так же не уверенность,лень.В Храм?схожу,но врятли это поможет.я верю что есть Все видящий ,но не так как его описали люди.Я без характерный без силы воли.Я не могу ни дня без,кофе,без сигарет.Последнее время часто алкоголь.От того что однинок часто занимаюсь мастурбацией.Нету у меня будущего,я овощь.Обычное животное.Ни достоин любви,не собираюсь чтоб тащили такую обузу как я.Жалкую.девушку уже никогда не будет,работы и нормально й жизни тоже,так как все надо начать сначала.Это тяжело,так как я нахожусь на уровне обезьяны.мне 25 и я потерял свое время.Во всем виноват я сам!И помочь могу себе только сам.Но зачем?Семьи не будет,работы нормальной не будет,жилья не будет.Трудно жить в этом образе неудачника.Я незнаю что делать..Как себя побороть,как поставить себе цели,как поверить в себя.Я не хочу умирать,да и не собираюсь от своих рук.Но жить не могу так.",

1,want to die,
1,", I will soon be 18 years old and I am already planning my suicide from about 14 years old, if not earlier. I know that this decision is very stupid, because I haven't even seen life normally yet, and so on. I decided for myself that if everything that is now bad in my life does not change, I will commit suicide. Many teenagers often think about their status, about who they are in the society of their peers, and I am no exception. My decision completely depends on this. Already in elementary school, I considered myself a trash, a stupid girl who was not needed by anyone, and over time this opinion of myself only got worse. With each new acquaintance, my self-esteem fell, I was not really loved, and almost always I feel humiliated. I do not know how to communicate, as soon as I want to say something, it turns out some kind of crap, I am constantly dull, I cannot be cheerful, smart, it is difficult to find a topic for conversation with me, despite the fact that now the future of a modern person depends on how he knows how to attract people to himself, be interesting, because without the support of friends you are no one. I cannot live like this, I myself am to blame for the fact that I simply cannot put together a few words. A person is a social being and a person who does not know how to correctly and beautifully express his thoughts will always remain aloof. I do not want to be constantly on the sidelines, it seems to me that no one needs me. I just can't prove myself in anything, I have no talents. Why should I live if not even for someone, I myself push people away from myself. I’m a dummy, I’m really stupid. I see no reason to live if I don’t have the necessary skills. I don’t want to live my life asking for friendship with someone, I don’t want to just exist.",
1,". Polina is my name. I am 14 years old. Tell me what to do, my life is just awful and I'm not exaggerating. Let's start with my family. My mother works as the main formoceft, her salary is not small.",
1,I have two children and a week ago I almost committed suicide.,
1,What to do next?,
1,"I have a problem since childhood, I cannot cope with myself and steal money from my parents, or rather, at first it all started with money from a piggy bank and then I began to steal money from my mother, then from my stepfather, most of all I want to cry from my mother's misunderstanding, she does not understand that like an ordinary person (14 years old) I need a day, personal money for my expenses to spend on myself today I had a fight with my mother and she said that she didn’t want to educate me and didn’t want to have anything to do with me and what if she would have the opportunity to return everything back, she would not give birth to me, she also said that ""today I will go and roll a statement on you and say that I am already in such a state that I am ready to kill you"" before this statement in my direction, I told her talked about how she would help me cope with my addiction to steal money, she said that I would imagine that I live in a forest and there is only a forest around and nothing else, I told her that maybe we’ll take me to a psychologist, what did she say thatshe has no desire and she does not want to spend money on me, there were also a lot of obscene words both from her and from my side, since I have neither the nerves nor the patience to listen to her humiliating words anymore. She said that she did not want to communicate with the whiner whom she hates because I constantly feel sorry for myself and do nothing to stop stealing, I tried but I can't get it when friends go to the movies they take popcorn and drink and after the movie they go to the cafe and even shopping, if I didn’t steal, I wouldn’t even have enough money for water, they only give me money for a ticket. When school started, my mother refused to give me money for a full trip and only gave me half and I had to steal money for a full trip I am generally silent about the school cafeteria, she does not consider it necessary to give money for food, since I am already fat. I cannot work because my mother does not allow and study does not. All summer I am with her and even on the street I have to ask for time off to go for a walk. I myself already approached her with options for working as a distributor of newspaper leaflets, since for my age only this is possible in our state. I hate my stepfather and he also me because I steal from him, he often swears because of me and my mother and I have 2 sisters, these are his children, and I, from another, I am the oldest in the family. Mom said that if it were not for me, she would never have fought with her husband and they would be happy, so I think she might just leave home, but just where? I have no real relatives who will understand and accept me. And in an orphanage or boarding school, it's scary, I also don't want to spoil my mother's name by the fact that her daughter is a thief, I don't want to be reproached and said that she is a bad mother, I just want to disappear imperceptibly so that they would forget and remember me.",
1,"Good day. We stopped paying at work. I need to change it accordingly. But the fact is that I find it difficult to get along with people and I’m almost to death afraid of new acquaintances, groups. I don’t know how to establish ""chemistry"" when communicating with people and from that I feel I am distant and wildly worried in the team, as a result of which I start to stupid and frankly fall down and therefore it is hard for me to work. I am a watchman. There are few people, there is little attention, most of all, but the salary is low. It's time to change my job, but because of the above I can’t I am frankly afraid. I have tried to do something with myself, but the fear does not go away and it only gets stronger over the years. Therefore, I don’t understand how I can continue to exist because of this fear. Frankly speaking, life is going downhill. Especially considering the fact that I'm already 28 soon. Don't think I'm not a mattress, but the fear inside is stronger, but I also need to change my job. I don’t want to work as a garbage man or a cleaner. I don’t know how to resolve my situation. Please tell me what to do. Thank you.",
1,Good day.,
1,". The fact is that at the end of January I lost, perhaps, the person closest to me - my grandfather. But he was also a father to me. No one loved me more than he. As soon as I was informed of death, I had my first panic attack. And after that everything seemed to be in a fog .. as if it was all not with me. As if he just held my hand yesterday and asked how I was doing. At first I could not accept the news of his death, it seemed to me that it was not true and I was about to wake up and everything would be the same. At the funeral, I hardly cried, I basically keep my emotions to myself, but the further, the worse I got. A week later, I fell ill with a common cold, I cured it. But since then, I have a constant temperature of 37.3-3, terrible weakness, a complete lack of appetite (I eat a little, my mother makes me), fatigue. I have not gone to school for almost two months (1 year of college). And I don't even rewrite lectures. My mother and I went to a psychologist, but she only said that we need to try to be distracted. Then we went to a psychotherapist, now I go to her for sessions, but it seems to me that this does not help much. And now, after so much time, I begin to realize that it will not be the same as before. On the one hand, I understand that I am young, I have my whole life ahead of me, but on the other, I see no reason to live. I seem to have no emotions.",
1,"Now, for three long and painful years for me, I do not know what a normal sleep and a normal, happy life are. Every (!) Night I fall asleep with tears and with the thought with which I wake up in the morning. This prevents me from studying, I become isolated, I stop communicating with the outside world, there are sudden mood swings and there is already an unstable nervous system and a disturbed psyche.",
1,"! Quite recently, I began to have incomprehensible situations and thoughts. For some reason, I suddenly came to the question: Why live if we will die anyway? I thought about the meaning of life, but did not find the answer. Die? I still have not I would like to, but it’s a pity to part with friends, acquaintances, which I don’t have so many. The fact is that I can’t just come up and, for example, get to know a person. For the same reason, I’m not familiar and with a guy from school, with whom I have been in love for almost a year. Well, no, well, what is it? I go to the musical. And there is a bummer. I liked one girl in the choir (just like a person). I would like to be friends with her. But no! I I don’t know her either. In general, this is kind of crazy! A little more and more and more thoughts come to mind about suicide ...",
1,Greetings. I want to express the boiling over all this time.,
1,"It's been a year since my husband left me for another. I still can't put up with him, I always think of him. Recently I thought, everything, let go. No. It hurts, lonely, empty, absolutely no reason to live. Sin, I know, but recently I regretted it, that I didn't have the strength to leave and not suffer.",
1,I don’t want to live. It’s hard to live. It’s painful to live.,
1,I voluntarily want to die.,
1,". I don't know if it is possible to help me, but still I still hope to find help. The fact is that 3.5 years ago my younger brother unexpectedly died. At the funeral service, I prayed strongly that God would accept his Soul and forgive him for his sins. Yes, we rarely went to church, although we believed in God. After the funeral service, it was like an explosion in my head, I dramatically lost 15 kg in a week, my whole life flew before my eyes, instantly realized all my sins, began to run to church with fright to confess, even took unction, but did not feel relief. Inner emptiness, as if I lost connection with the Universe, I feel like a cut bush, for symptoms of apathy and depression, with the exception of a tendency to suicide, because the conviction in your head sits that there is no Soul, but how will you die if there is no Soul? Help, I beg, my daughter is only 13 years old, her mother is elderly, I can hardly work, my brain is gradually atrophying, medications do not work, neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist, no one can help. I communicated with a psychic, said that part of my Soul is with my brother and I myself will not return it, some rituals are needed! And there is no money, a lot of debts, I don't know what to do at all. SAVE IF YOU CAN, ASK YOU! I beg you!",
1,"Please help, I don’t know how to live.",
1,". My husband left me, I was left with two children. His parents hated me from the very beginning of marriage, and I have nowhere to wait for support. I do not want to live, I cannot live without him. Every day is a torment and test. Every second I ask God to take my life. It is unbearable. I want to commit suicide.",
1,"my father, who in my life is no one at all, who bullies for a year, extorts money from my grandmother (his mother), threatens all my relatives. unfortunately, I am underage and cannot take any measures. under the influence of herbs / drugs and other rubbish , this unbalanced beast destroys everything around him. he is mentally inadequate, he can stab and kill his mother (respectively, my grandmother), strangle his father with a pillow (at the moment, my grandfather is under a stroke, in a coma). I really ask for help, this man comes out dry, the police do nothing, but I am very scared in this position, I am not able to help. Besides, he was in a psychiatric hospital many times, but nothing has changed, he is everything It also scares / threatens and almost kills. Many cases were closed, for example, at the dacha he and his friends were stoned with drugs, I don’t know for sure, but my grandmother said it was spice. Bottom line: a person died from an overdose, and this devil got out and was released. not so long ago, he smashed my mother's window in the store, but I am completely silent about the fact that he throws himself with a knife.",
1,"My wife divorced me, I have no friends. she says that she stopped loving me. although she is a failure, I had a strong fight with her before that, I was constantly jealous of her, swore with her, rude to her, called her names. I agree, I hurt her a lot. But how many times have I asked for forgiveness, but nothing happens. I don't see any more meaning in this life without her and children.",
1,"Good afternoon ... I don't even know where to start. In general, I have always been prone to depression. But the worst thing began in February, I had constant tantrums, real seizures, I cried all day, I was afraid to look in the mirror, even covered my face from my parents. For two months I did not go to school and did not leave the room at all. I tried to commit suicide. I had bulimia, although I carefully hid it from my parents, I overcame it on the advice on the Internet. (Although now, after eating, I'm very nauseous. Therefore, it's easier for me not to eat at all, I am starving, or I eat up to 500 calories ... I'm obsessed with all this, I constantly count calories, I want painful thinness .. I lie and I carefully hide everything, my mother believes that I eat.) But now about something else. Then my mother took me to a psychotherapist and I was prescribed a strong antidepressant, started drinking, helped, went to school. Passed several non-certifications in the 3rd quarter. But then I got sick with the flu, after about two weeks I recovered, but ... I started something similar. Mom is now hiding an antidepressant from me, she is afraid that I will swallow too much, and when she comes home late at night from work, she forgets to give a pill. Again I can't go out, panic starts, I can't do anything, I don't eat, I practically don't sleep, the situation is overshadowed by the fact that we live with an eternally drunk grandfather. I don't see the point in anything ... I'm superfluous in my class, before they beat me, humiliated me in every possible way, now they just completely ignore me. Everything is pointless, why do something if the end will come at any moment anyway? Why should I go to school, take the remaining non-certifications? ... They want to keep me for 2 years, but if this happens, I will definitely commit suicide. But I can't go to school because I'm superfluous. Superfluous. I’m scary, silent, I don’t have an iPhone and expensive clothes, I’m getting ridiculous for that. We have been moving from June to another city, but even this does not motivate us in any way. I just want to live a normal life, like normal people go to school, love myself, communicate normally ... I'm tired of upsetting my parents, I'm tired of everything ... How can I find motivation in something, how can I go to school? I am very afraid .... I have a terrible voice, wrong breathing, I am afraid to speak. I'm ugly. There is still time, there is a chance that I will fix everything and will not stay for the second year, but I cannot bring myself to do anything .... I hope for support, thank you all in advance for your help ..",
1,It is very difficult to tell anyone that you do not want to live at all.,
1,"I can no longer live in fear of pain .. I have trigeminal neuralgia .. This is a terrible, excruciating disease .. It hurts to eat, speak, even breathe .. Pain, pain, pain .. Medicines no longer help .. No one can me no one can help .. I want to live .. But when pain comes I dream of death .. I'm scared to wait for another attack .. What should I do .. I don't want to suffer .. There are so many people around and everyone sympathizes, but no one can understand this fear, icy and sticky .. I'm lonely .. tortured .. crushed .. I can't see a way out .. somebody .. save me",
1,". The fact is that for about a month now I have been in a strange state, similar to depression. I'll start in order. About a month ago, I liked a girl. Everything was good in life. Mom and Dad loved me, never hurt me, supported me. I had a lot of friends. There were no problems with my studies. In a word: everything was fine. It so happened that I could not meet with that girl right away, because we had a vacation. I also could not invite you to somewhere outside the school for certain circumstances, which I will omit here. From that moment on, strange things began to happen to me. Apathy for everything appeared. Lost appetite. What I liked before has ceased to like. Even that which brings pleasure. I thought it was because of this girl, and when I meet her, everything will be fine. We met, walked several times, but this state did not pass! I didn't know what to do. My brain became kind of slowed down. Because of this, I have not gone to school for a week now, I stopped attending all the additional classes that I liked so much! I hardly communicate with my friends, because I just can not. Against the background of all these events, I had a strange feeling that communication between people is something abnormal. It should not be. Although I understand with my head that this is completely normal. I do not know. Dad went to watch. Relations with my mother worsened. It is very hard for her at work, and here I have become such a burden. She cries all the time, and I can't help it. If everything was okay with me, I would just get up and start solving my problems. But because of this ""illness"" I cannot. Already 2 times I have been to a psychologist. I went through all the examinations, got tested. They say that I am healthy. Now, because of this condition, so many problems have appeared, and the condition itself appeared even before the problems appeared. This condition caused these problems. I can't read a book or watch a movie. there people talk. I think this is not normal. We are just texting with the girl. I say that I'm just sick. She calls me for a walk, but I can't ... I'm tired. I want to die. What should I do?",
1,"From the age of 11 I began to wish for death. It all started gradually, at first I just fell into a depressive state, every day it progressed, and that's what I came to.",
1,"I know my story will be different from others. The point is that I have nothing to complain about. I have a loving family, I study on a budget, I entered it myself. I have a boyfriend and friends. But you know, many people say: this is such nonsense that others have real problems and so on. And I sympathize with other people, but maybe everyone has their own endurance threshold, and I don't have it at all.",
1,"I am 14 years old and I want to die. Only one pleasant one for which I want to die. You may think this is stupid. But if you had the same situation, you would be just as depressed. Five years ago, I broke my lip and they sewed it up at the emergency room, while I was not even prescribed any ointment against edema and scars! As a result, after a few weeks, I had a scar. And over the years it gets bigger and bigger as the lips grow. Sometimes I can just sit down and cry, cry, cry. This scar is convex, on the upper lip in the middle, like a bag falls down. And then he is not straight in the middle, but a little to the right. That is why it is unpleasant to look at it when talking! When I shoot myself on video, I just want to shoot, there is still nothing in the mirror, since there is a mirror image and the lip is not so uneven. But in life - horror! Sometimes I like some boy, but I am terribly afraid to walk with him because of that lip, fearing that he will only look there. That is why I do not go for a walk with anyone, I have withdrawn into myself. My appearance is beautiful in itself, but this lip spoils everything, just everything! I'd rather be ugly, but with lips without scars. I am writing this and crying, because I no longer know how to decide. Plastic? And is it possible? Or just die. Of course I will not kill myself. But morally, I will definitely die soon.",

1,. I am almost 20 years old and I am not normal.,
1,". Perhaps this is a cry for help. Honestly, I don’t want to live, I don’t want to exist, and I would be very glad if I was not there or I was not born. I am 21 years old. The only daughter and most of all it upsets me that my parents have such a daughter. I would like to start all over again. The first thought about suicide appeared in my 4th grade, I do not even understand where these thoughts came from in the child. I didn't like my mother. Oan has always helped me financially. But we were not friends or close people with her, I could never share something intimate with her. Always loved dad more. And my parents are also unhappy now. They do not love each other. And we live like 3 different people. I know that my thoughts are inconsistent, but I would like to speak out. I didn't have a boyfriend and a serious relationship. There were no dates, probably because of my self-esteem, opinion. Everything passed me by. I just dreamed about everything in my thoughts and lived as if not in reality. During school time, she was fond of languages ​​and in the first year of university did not notice her apathy. I tried to take part at least somewhere. I went to Korean courses. My specialty at the university did not interest me and I really did not go and missed a lot of classes. Bottom line: I paid a lot of money, i.e. my parents for which I feel guilty and in my diploma all 3 are almost. And after school I would very much like to leave, but no one helped me or informed me about it. And out of hopelessness I stayed here. And I knew that this would be the bottom and end of my life. From the 2nd year, I abandoned all my courses, it seemed that all plans, dreams collapsed and I just decided to go with the flow. And that's what this led to. I am not working now. I don't really leave the house. I am absolutely not interested in anything. No friends, young man. I look at everyone and I want to cry. All live, have families or build a career, go abroad and improve. And I kind of want it, but I can't. I don't even want to wake up in the morning. It's some kind of groundhog day. I hide in my room like in some kind of prison. And so it has been for 3 years. And now I look around and understand how pathetic. I want to blame everyone and don't know who. Only myself and my parents. I can't even bring myself to live for them. It's scary to realize this, but after graduating from university I want to die, because I know and there is no end to it. For all relatives, I am a pitiful creature, and even for my mother. And I cannot overcome myself because I have nothing to live. I can't even name one reason. Sometimes for moments I imagine my death and I understand how hard it was for my parents and it was easier for them without me. Do not feel this shame for me and hear reproaches from them. It would be easier for them too. You know what it feels like when you wake up and there is no goal of plans even for the day. Some kind of abyss. Everything seems unattainable and impossible. I don't even know how to describe it. I would like to get away from all this. I have absolutely no feelings. Everything in myself or I covered my emotions to such an extent that I can't even show them or not feel them now. God I dream that I lay down and not wake up.

I take medication throughout the day to dull this mad anxiety. I practically don't sleep at night: I jump up because of constant nightmares. My classmates were writing a mock exam in basic math, which I, to my shame, fail without getting the minimum score. Everyone passed the threshold except me. It's a shame. Painfully. Disgusting. I feel incredibly stupid: I solve variations every day, but unsuccessfully. If I don’t pass it, I won’t get a certificate. And the ill-fated summer is soon, and I do not wear open clothes because of the complexes, which have grown into some kind of super-idea.

1,". I've been thinking about suicide constantly for the last couple of years. This year, thoughts became so obsessive that I began to regard the death as the only correct decision. I can’t commit suicide because it really doesn’t solve anything, and it will most likely only get worse. The problem is that over the past few years there have been a lot of difficulties because of which I got depressed. The brother is an alcoholic, quarrels in the family, mom has loans, moving, parting with a loved one. Everything was aggravated by the fact that when I finished my studies the question of work arose, but I realized that I did not want to do this. And I began to learn from who I really want to be. But I started to hate myself for the lost time. I am sorry that I did not immediately start doing what was important to me. Now I would already be working. But I can't, because I don't have enough skill, and time is running out. And again I hate myself even more, because now it is unrealistic for me to find a job somewhere, two years have passed, and I still could not. I'm afraid to work, I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm afraid that I will not fulfill the task. I see how other people are also not sure, but they go, and then everything is fine with them. And I stupidly cannot. Because of this, the fear became unbearable, I became very lazy in recent months, lost the meaning of life, became insecure. Mom supports me and does not blame me, because all my life I helped her as best I could and was responsible, that is, therefore, she trusts me, but for myself I am zero without a stick. In 2016, the parting happened, the whole year I was on my nerves, I did not develop in any way, I did not study. And now realizing that two years were wasted !!! I do not have the understanding and strength of how I can love myself and accept. I hate myself for the wasted time. And because I can't work now. I want to end this and myself, because before it seemed to me how great it was to find my place, but now it seems terribly difficult and almost impossible to me, and these thoughts cause me terrible pain, because in the eyes of society and friends I am a lazy schmuck. I want to work and find myself in this life. Please help me with advice on what to do, what to do to get out of this state?",
1,"I cannot be realized in life.

In the ninth grade, I began to train, I started with bodybuilding, not mine went to Muay Thai and kettlebell lifting. Physically I could already fight back, but morally not. The bullying was no longer ignored. After school I entered college in the first year, I was pinched, but then I got used to it and people reached out to me. I myself participated in the bullying, but I never crossed the line and could slow down the process in time. On the gym I did the most pull-ups, push-ups, pushing thirty-two kettlebells. I performed in Muay Thai, kettlebells and arm wrestling. Friends appeared after college. After college I got a job and it seemed like returned to school, I became withdrawn, began to behave strangely, as a result, I quit. Now I don’t want to go to work, I don’t even want to go to interviews, I’ve worked nothing and they look at me suspiciously when I’m working. the psychologist did not go, I didn’t like the experience of communication.

He forbade me to go to school several times. I am not in any social network, because I cannot. It all started when they sent him my photos from social networks, where I was in shorts, after that he beat me up and forced me to leave. This was repeated several times.

I don't want anything, the time is gone. I have no strength at all, and I don't want to live. I'm not dying, just because it will hurt my parents and my sister and nieces. This is not salvation, but simply a hindrance. I go to a psychologist, meditation, church, yoga, everything by.

I understand that this is all a disease, but my patience and my mother are bursting. It is very difficult to live with it. It's hard for me to see my mother fading away every day. Sometimes I can't restrain myself, I break down, scream and cry from powerlessness (On top of that, our family always lacks money. Mom cannot work, because she takes care of my father, I cannot because of study, and my health itself is not very excellent. Besides all these problems, there is one more.

Is it a shame? A thin, colorless teenager, they called names offensively. Already in high school I learned to take care of myself , use cosmetics. All my free time I sewed clothes for myself. There were girlfriends, friends, sympathies. There was the first unrequited love, I knew that such a handsome man was not for me, but fell in love ... Well, at least I did not leave a pregnant woman. I graduated from university, my future husband met, love, common interests, after 7 months a wedding ... Was happy on the wedding day. Three years later, a son was born (happiness) Literally half a year later, he began to have health problems - allergies. The whole body was covered with a rash, and later began to suffocate. My whole life was devoted to finding a cure for my son. But I did not forget about my husband, that is, I tried to look decent, etc. I myself am a doctor, realizing that my son has nothing helps ... I read a bunch of books and began to temper my son, gave him to sports, adjusted food, took him to the sea. And the son straightened out, in sports, achievements, in studies, an excellent student! The sore has receded. All this time I had to live with my parents and sister. What was going on, my father terrarized me as best he could (without witnesses) and I endured, there was no place to go. Sister saw-disassembly, screams periodically. My husband solved all the problems in his own way. I began to fornicate with everyone in a row. I endured for a long time, saved my family ... as a result, betrayal, divorce. I did not pay alimony, I grew it myself.

It crushes day after day, I constantly think about this betrayal of the most beloved and dear person, whom they met for several years and made plans, were going to get married. I can't forget her, maybe because no one is around. There was never a family, my grandmother raised me. 2 years ago I moved to her village from the city, because at her age it was impossible to leave her alone, and it was not possible to take her to the city, because there was no home of her own. Already half a year without work, which simply does not exist in our village. There are no friends either, maybe because I moved and it is difficult for me to come. At first we talked on the internet, corresponded, but over time this became a rarity. I became angry and irritable, I drink a lot, from loneliness and despair I climb on the wall.

1,"Не знаю зачем сюда пишу... Наверное, потому что какая-то часть меня пытаеться спастись... но сама-то я понимаю, что это совершеннонезачем делать... Я абсолютно виновата в страшной трагедии, которая случилась с моим любимым братишкой... Началось, всё ещё очень давно... ещё в моём глубоком детстве... и ещё до появления братишки. Моя мама прекрасная, образованная женщина, очень сильная и властная, позитивная и оптимистичная на людях, дома превращалась в жестокого тирана, которая срывала всю свою злость за напряженный образ жизни и неудачи в личных отношениях, на своих домашних. Козлами отпущения обычно была я и её мама, моя бабуля, которая по характеру была просто божьим одуванчиком и не могла ей противостоять. Уже лет с семи я своим детским умом устав от постоянных избиений, стала понимать, что нужно спасаться и всё своё детство мечтала поскорее убежать от неё. Когда мне было 9 - появился мой братишка и мама как-то даже похорошела и немного успокоилась от того, что встретила нового мужа и создала сново семью... Успокоилась, как оказалось ненадолго... Личные и денежные проблемы постоянно расшатывали её. Она всё больше срывалась на мне, моё желание уйти возрастало и в конце концов в 20 я это сделала, вышла замуж и уехала. А братулечка остался в этом аду. Но связи я со своей семьёй, конечно, не теряла, жили мы в одном городе, с братусиком дружили и ему в его 20 тоже удалось вырваться, переехать на съёмную квартиру. При этом мы нормально учились, работали. Не зарабатывали миллионы, конечно, по маленько, но нам хватало. А мама не давала нам покоя, её ничего в нас не устраивало. Не там работаем, не то делаем, цеплялась ко всему подряд, контролировала каждый наш шаг, постоянно требовала к себе внимания и это нормально, я её понимаю, если бы она не вела себя при всех наших контактах настолько агрессивно... Я, конечно, тоже не ангел, иногда отвечала ей, довольно жёстко... много всего было... И жалко её было тоже... но её агрессия с годами постепенно нарастала, ещё больше. Иногда не на долго она успокаивалась, а потом опять. Братишка в 24 решил жениться, на девочке, которую знал с детства, я была так рада за него, у них родился малыш, но из за временных денежных трудностей им пришлось поселиться в квартиру не далеко от мамы, которую мы всей семьёй приобрели когда-то. То есть снять жильё и жить подальше от неё возможности не было. А я к этому времени строила свою жизнь дальше и 5 лет назад уехала на учебу в Европу. Тут новая учёбы, новая работа, новое замужество: меня всё это закрутило, а им там оказывается становилось всё хуже и хуже... Когда я звонила, говорили, что всё хорошо. Братишка у меня, вообще, партизан был, ничего из него не вытянешь... а жена иногда рассказывала, что не так у них там всё гладко, особенно с мамой. Девочка была приезжей из далекой деревеньки, но спокойной и очень хорошей. С братишкой они познакомились ещё в детстве на учёбе в хореографическом училище. Детки не из города жили там при училище в интернате, вот и она жила. Мама стала её объвинять с годами, что ей нужна только квартира от братишки... и ещё много всякого напридумывала... Господи, если бы ко мне так относилась моя теперешняя свекровь, не представляю даже как бы это было... Вообщем, дело дошло до развода... и девочка с сыном уехали обратно в деревню, лиж бы не слушать все эти скандалы... Пол года назад братишка стал просить меня о помощи, чтобы забрала его... а я ему сказала, потерпи, вот дождусь я здесь сейчас ПМЖ и летом приеду, обсудим всё, подумаем... Не дождался... ушел неделю назад, поверитьне могу... И зачем мне эта виза нужна была... надо было ехать тогда, полгода назад, всего полгода... как-то решить этот конфликт между ними... И ведь я чувствовала, что добром это всё незакончиться... Он жену свою вернуть хотел, хотел, чтобы сын в столице прописан был, чтобы в садик здесь ходил и в школу... а мама была постоянно против их семьи... против этой девочки... Вот так всё и закончилось... И я не понимаю зачем мне теперь жить... я своим ""подожди"" и убила его... ведь знала, что нельзя оставлять его одного там... знала... я одна знала всё и могла помочь... не помогла... конец... Надо было, приехать туда, забрать его, оставить маму с её пожеланиями и планами на её жизнь... Не могу теперь жить с этим...",

1,"Извините, если получится очень сбивчиво, трудно собраться с мыслями, не знаю с чего начать. У меня запредельный уровень страха и тревоги, подавленной агрессии. Я абсолютно не могу противостоять наглости, всегда теряюсь,потом мучаюсь неделями из-за таких ситуаций. Меня очень, просто невероятно злят приезжие из Средней Азии, простите за неполиткорректность, но пишу как есть, не хочу обидеть интеллигентных людей среди них. Даже не представляя ничего из себя физически, ведут себя как бронепоезда. Мне невыносимо что они толкают женщин в автобусе, а я не в состоянии сделать замечание, стесняюсь этих же женщин, публики. Не так давно я смог сделать одному такому замечание, очень тихо, он вышел за мной и начал на меня наезжать, я побил его, он даже не пытался дать сдачи и убежал, я вслед крикнул ему ""веди себя нормально, или вали из моей страны, так трудно что ли вести себя нормально?"" После нескольких таких случаев их развязного поведения в транспорте я вообще не могу им пользоваться, да и на улицу практически не выхожу, это для меня пытка, я всего боюсь и злюсь на себя и на людей. Мне страшно, что я так и сгнию в этой квартире у бабушки, где я живу. У меня ни работы нормальной, ничего нет. Я очень сильно мечтаю ходить на спортивную секцию, у меня возле дома они есть, относительно недалеко. Я купил боксерские перчатки, кроссовки, но вот начинаю собираться, и меня начинает трясти буквально от страха, от стеснения перед людьми там, на тренировке, что что-то плохое произойдет, или там будут те же люди, которые ненавидят русских и не скрывают этого, страх унижений, высмеивания, того, что на меня тренер накричит, в общем всего вообще. Я уже ГОДАМИ из-за этого не могу пойти на тренировки, и годами мечтаю об этом. Я знаю, что мне скорее всего будет лучше, но я просто не могу и все. Куда начинал ходить, никуда не проходил больше месяца из-за страхов и тревоги выйти из дома и тренироваться среди людей. На личного тренера или на психолога у меня денег нет и не предвидится. Вот и сегодня я начал собирать вещи, но никуда не пошел. От страха так устал, что просто спать захотелось. Но не могу же я всю жизнь лежать у бабушки на диване и смотреть сериальчики. Кем работать я тоже не знаю, по образованию я юрист, но работать им мне не нравилось никогда, я несколько раз пытался, по 3 месяца в среднем работал, а с последнего места меня уволили из-за того, что у меня месяц была бессонница просто жуткая, и я ничего не соображал на работе. С тех пор работаю фрилансером буквально за еду, за 200-300 рублей в день, в интернете пишу стенограммы, просто чтобы бабушке не быть в тягость финансово и хоть чем-то заниматься. Я очень боюсь, что мое письмо не опубликуют из-за того, что я написал про приезжих из Средней Азии, но я написал как есть, это то, что делает мою жизнь невыносимой в первую очередь, когда ты в родном городе постоянно чувствуешь себя человеком второго сорта перед ними, не отрицая, что среди них есть и хорошие люди. Поконичить самоубийством ""мешает"" мама, я очень ее люблю. Причина такой трусости и тревоги наверное в том, что отец со мной очень жестоко себя вел, при этом он был бизнесменом, гораздо больше времени проводил дома, чем это может себе позволить человек, работающий с 9 до 6, и шпынял меня постоянно, бил так, что я сикался, уже в сознательном причем возрасте, очень критиковал. Такое ощущение, что он меня просто сознательно и садистски ломал. В любом коллективе меня начинает кто-то один травить, обычно женщина, и хотя остальные относятся ко мне нормально, мне там становится тяжело и приходится покидать коллектив. Даже если все хорошо, все равно я вжимаю голову в плечи, жду, что сейчас начнется, потому что вижу, насколько эти люди раскорванней меня. Помогите пожалуйста советом, как мне заставить себя пойти на тренировки уже, это мне очень нужно, это моя мечта. ",

Then we moved to another place. The truth is now your home, your own room. And there was a one-room apartment in the city. But now we live outside the city. Now she began to work by profession. But it’s so hard to get to the city first, then to the place of work. It takes 2 hours to go there and back, in general it takes 4 hours to get there. How to get there: walk from home to the bus stop for about 17-20 minutes. Then while this bus leaves the terminal to the village limit for half an hour, then go to the city for half an hour. Further from the border of the city, transfer from there go to work for 30-40 minutes. In general, it takes 1 hour, 40 minutes. About 2 hours. Everyday. There is practically no time for myself. I come home, have supper somewhere for half an hour, and sleep. There is no time to spend in the morning. Hard physically. Dad can't talk about it, because it gets rash when I start this conversation ... when I say that I want to live in the city. All the time, whatever I do, I remember how well they lived in the city. It became difficult. no shops, provided no.,. I don't know how to deal with this. Dad used to commute to work. But I myself am still not getting used to it, although I have been walking like this for a year. But I'm afraid what will happen to my parents if I die ... by laying hands on myself. It is categorically impossible to move to the city, since rent there is not cheap, and if you sell this house that we live outside the city, then this is not enough for an apartment in the city, and there is no money for transport.

1,"! I want to start with the most basic problems of why I don’t want to live. Nothing turns out at all, in love the same story. I love two people. Everything would be fine ... But one guy and another girl. Dating two at the same time, it's not normal, but I love them in exactly the same way, no unnecessary feelings. I know that most of them will find me strange, but I cannot do otherwise. Well, as for studying. Every day I hear: ""You don't learn anything, so you won't pass the exams! You can't even solve the elementary"" I go to additional lessons: chemistry, English and mathematics. And nothing ... No result, even banging your head against the wall. Honestly already tired of achieving better results, tired of trying to arrange my life in terms of relationships. I have already forgotten how to look at people and how to react to their words. I am always alone, my parents come home late from work. We live well, we have everything, in two years we will move to Kudrovo closer to Peter. But I don't consider myself worthy of all this. Of course, I study quite well, but I can't do a lot of things, no matter how much I go to tutors. Even now, probably, while reading this text, you have noticed many mistakes. I apologize in advance, because in a hurry I try to fit everything that is going on in my head. I try to convey all my thoughts in simple sentences to make it clearer. In general: everything is bad, I am a pessimist to the core and a masochist who beats himself for every bad deed. It's impossible to live like that. Soon I have to decide on college, but since I'm afraid of people and somehow contacting them, it will be very difficult for me. Especially I don't know who to be, I don't see myself anywhere. Even in relationships. Neither with a guy nor with a girl, no matter how hard I was either thrown or my feelings faded over time. One good, kind, handsome and athletic. But with him there is nothing to talk about at all. And with the second one you can talk about anything. She loves the same as me. We communicate with her more often than with the first. I love both of them and I don't even know what to do for a person like me. I understand that this is wrong and strange. Therefore, I want to die. There are still problems, but these were the most basic. I want to understand whether I should live on or not? If I decide to continue living, how can I cope with my problems? Help me please!

I communicated with a man for more than 5 years, love, carrots ... Now it turned out that it was only on my part, and after him I was running, it turns out, as he told me ... At the moment I am six months old, the man left me three months ago, was left without work and livelihood ... I left a well-paid job for him, chose family life, so to speak ... I'm looking for a job, but the crisis is making itself felt, and my stomach is already visible, I understand that it's too late to look for something in my specialty ... There are no relatives, only my mother, who is 76 years old, her son will be 18, she is studying, you understand that there is no one to help ... All my life I pulled everything on myself, paid for everything and provided for her family ... Now debts for an apartment, for a loan are accumulating. I don’t know what to do, I understand that there’s no way out ... There’s no one to help, I don’t know how and what will happen next, I don’t know how I’m going to face and what I’ll do with the child ...

I have been doing sambo and judo for 3 years (no one has ever fought with me at school) and during training I hide all my anger. They beat me because I study poorly (I study at 4-5 and I NEVER had 3 in the quarter), they beat me for not going to training, although I try to go to them, but I can't allow it because I wouldn't even have time to do my homework. Out of 7 days I walk 5, they beat me for not walking the dogs, although it was not even I who started them, the dog that I got, was sent and still did not tell me. My father says that he has lost confidence and I am nobody for him, naturally there is a lot of swearing, there is a recording from a dictaphone, my mother supports it all, but without a mat, they strangled a lot, beat me with a belt, fists, slap in the face, I write this from a friend's phone, since I have not been with him for a year 2.

With friends it is clear, this option disappears, the next option is parents. I don't want to talk to them about it, that's all. They will understand, listen, I know, but they will not help in any way ... Yes, and I don’t really want to load them, since I have a younger brother who has problems with weight and speech, and his parents completely surrender to him, and I don’t mind, I do not consider myself deprived of attention in this regard, I understand everything, I want the best, I will not strain them once again. There is also a psychologist option. But as you understand, quietly go to a psychologist, for several sessions, leave a lot of money there, and buy a bunch of pills that he prescribes, you won't be able to do all this unnoticed ... So this is not an option. That's all. Therefore, I keep all this in myself ... I don't know how to explain it, it's not like pain, a certain heaviness inside, a clot of something heavy, negative, black, dark, evil in me, and it all sits in me, very deeply , and how the tumor grows more and more ... Something constantly hurts somewhere, there is some kind of discomfort everywhere, something constantly interferes, annoys, as soon as negative thoughts appear (and this is practically around the clock), a lump comes to the throat, I clench my teeth, clench my fists, close my eyes, endure so as not to cry like a woman, keep tears in myself to the last, and still let streams down my cheeks, and as a result I cry somewhere in a secluded place ... I don't like to go out, there people, a lot of people, I try to avoid them, to avoid their ridicule, insults, contemptuous and arrogant looks ... Constant sleepiness and vivacity due to insomnia, weakness and lethargy interfere with learning ... I think I need to explain why all this is, what kind of complexes. Complexes 3. This is about glasses, about acne, and about thinness. I can’t live like that, seriously, I’m 18 years old, I envy with black envy those who, from the age of 14-16, smoke, drink, go to clubs, go to appointments, have sex, yes, yes, I envy all of them, I want it this way live while I'm young!

There wasn’t even a day that I didn’t cry after her death. I became withdrawn and unsociable. There was anger, a strong resentment against her. How could she leave me ... She knew that I could not live without her ... She killed not only herself but also destroyed me all my life and left nothing. I am very lonely, dad does not really talk to me, he is also bad. Besides all this, I am sick, a rare disease. I hate myself ... God, how I hate myself. Mom has endured so much since I was 10 years old with me in hospitals.

I never knew how to communicate with people, to attract their attention, I was always strange. In adulthood, this did not disappear, but only intensified. Because in childhood everything could be attributed to childhood, to inexperience. And when an adult does not know how to do this, he seems completely strange. Because of this, I have not and did not have either a girlfriend or friends. My peers are already thinking about what their children will do after graduation, and I am still myself as a schoolboy. I cannot find a normal job. I can't even do any of them, I am constantly in conflict with the bosses, who treat me badly. And this attitude just pisses me off. All my childhood I spent in humiliation, in bullying classmates, and later classmates, and now when something like this happens at work, I immediately lose it. Sometimes I leave, but more often I am asked to vacate the place of more ideal slaves than me. The older I got, not gaining anything, but only losing over the years, for example, health every year gets worse and worse (my eyesight is very quickly lost and I am threatened with blindness in old age, besides, I am an asthmatic and a whole bunch of little things ), the less I had a desire to live, the less faith that something would change. I realized that I myself could not achieve anything, because, as I said above, I am a strange and limited person, only someone can help me. But people, on the contrary, only laugh at me, at my helplessness, assert themselves. I'm tired. At some point, I gave up ... I didn't immediately kill myself, I just stopped trying to change something, began to go with the flow, do stupid things.

More precisely, I did not notice. I have already died. Physically I am still alive. But he has already died mentally. I have no plans for my future. I have no faith in my future. I have no people for whom I need to live. I probably should have already died from some accident or my own illnesses, which are exacerbated by me in moments of severe depression (several times I almost suffocated from asthma in my sleep). After all, I have already dropped my hands so much ... I did a lot of things that I shouldn't have done if I continued to live. That is, I behaved as if I had to die in the near future.

1,I want to share my problem,
1,". Recently, I have been thinking a lot about suicide, since I no longer see a way out of all this. The fact is that I have a terrible family, my father is a tyrant and despot, my mother is a typical victim, she endures everything and can protect herself or her children. I remember the beatings, the oars in the house since childhood, and now I am already 24. They constantly swear, my father beats my mother very hard, destroys the house, sometimes he hits me when I am at home, I am afraid that he will kill her someday. And he already threatens to do it. except for work I do not go anywhere, as I am depressed and have no friends. I am constantly in fear for my mother, for myself, for my sister. Leaving to live separately is an opportunity, but I cannot leave them. How can I then live if something terrible happens? I will blame myself for everything. Don't write about the police, they don't care, even if they come - they won't be able to influence my father, and even my mother will defend him herself and deny everything I have told. His mother apparently does not want to leave him, since childhood I have been persuading her to leave this mentally ill person. (a tyrant at home, with others a mouse, but he told how he crippled people in the army). Mother wants to leave in words, but in deeds - zero. She always finds excuses that people will say that relatives will say what, who will think what, is afraid that it is expensive to shoot, we will be left without a piece of bread. She does not understand that life is most important! I'm tired of these constant showdowns, separating my father, running around neighbors, calling relatives. Everyone knows what he is, no one wants to contact us and communicate anymore. The guy called to live separately, could not leave and leave her own. As a result, he found a normal girl from a normal family. And I lagged behind with these egoists who think only of themselves. Have not learned to get along in almost 30 years of marriage. I am ashamed of them, ashamed of myself, that I look like my father whom I hate (he himself achieved this, that his family hates him, for his antics), so I just can’t accept myself, love. Only self-hatred, because I look like them. I'm afraid of everything, depression, sometimes panic attacks, no strength or hope for a better future. They eat up all my energy, I live like a squeezed lemon. I am so tired, there is no need to live. There is no one to talk to, no support, never, a loner all his life. Despite a complete family. They never cared before me only when they needed a whipping pillow. As a child, my father beat me badly, my mother sometimes. The fact that she didn't want me, because I look like him. There are still the scars from childhood beatings. I am nothing, and I will have nothing. I believe in God, I was baptized 2 years ago. By the way, the parents were against it, I had to do it in secret from everyone. But where is God, when I was so trampled into the mud, I am constantly afraid to be at home, with my mother, whose sister I cannot leave to the mercy of fate! My father hates me fiercely because I called my neighbors. turns to me with obscenities. Constantly humiliates. I'm so tired! So tired!!!",

I constantly listen to music from my childhood and imagine that I am with them in my childhood. Now I am 24 there are no friends, on the Internet I do not communicate with almost anyone (no desire). All brothers and Sisters have families and children. I live with a guy with his parents, where his sister also lives with her husband and children. I feel like a stranger and unnecessary everywhere in whose family I would not come. I am very withdrawn and not talkative. I don't share with anyone about my ""cockroaches in my head"" even with my boyfriend. Although at first I tried to tell you why I could suddenly cry, but it is useless if the person himself has not experienced it. Moreover, he does not understand syntimentality. We do not go for a walk at all, because he said that he was not a romantic: / What emotional conversations there can be.",

I don't want to see or hear anyone or anything. Every morning starts with tears and a lump in the throat. From the fact that I am already 24 years old soon, and I have nothing. There is no education, no job, no profession. There are no real friends, otherwise only those who call when they themselves need something from me. Relatives do not care about me, they have spat for a long time already, having probably decided that I am a vegetable that will not achieve anything. In principle, they are right. I don’t want absolutely nothing. I don't want to go to work without education, where they pay you 100 hryvnia for 12 hours. I can't work because I live far from the city. I can’t study because I don’t have money for it. I live with my grandmother in a house without a normal shower, in moldy walls. There is no normal phone or nice clothes. It’s just a shame to be around my acquaintances, because I’m such a failure. On top of that, I really like one guy. But he is the complete opposite of me. He successfully makes money on the Internet, every day he has a holiday. Meeting with friends, buying a car, all sorts of modern gadgets and more. He does what he wants and does not need anyone. Only I began to forget him a little bit, as if he appeared on purpose a month later and invited him and his friends to rest. He absolutely clearly and openly uses me, knows that I really like it, but at the same time he kisses, and having done his ""job"", he stops even looking in my direction, explaining that he is ""not ready for a serious relationship."" It is clear that my desires do not interest him at all and I understand this with my mind .. But I can’t do anything. Like a rag, like a call girl, I rush to him on the first call, I just can't refuse. After all, I am just pleased to even be with him. I turned down more than one guy because of him, and he just doesn't care. This is such an irony, and all this is sprinkled with the fact that I am absolutely hopeless and dependent. I feel that I no longer need anyone and no one needs me. And yet I absolutely lost the desire to fight. I want to commit suicide and no longer suffer.",

Life has long lost all meaning for me, my whole life is ruined, I believe that this cannot continue, I want to die for a long time, especially after everything that happened. My parents are divorced, my mother drinks, my father was sitting, (in childhood they beat me). My mother always thought that I was somehow different there: I eat badly and stuff like that. In graduation class, she went to a psychiatrist (children's, and despite the fact that she is an alcoholic), she said everything about me there (by the way, I didn’t even speak to her personally, only my mother spoke), the papers said “she eats badly, doesn’t want to go to school,” etc. Isn't it nonsense ? how can a diagnosis be made? (put me in a psychiatric hospital, what diagnosis I don't know), because of this I was not at school for a long time, I received my certificate with triplets, and did not enter any college, I sit at home, I am in shock, I don’t know what continue to do. My mother ruined my whole life, future, with a certificate from the monetary policy, with such a certificate, without friends, without a boyfriend, without support, with such parents, what to do, how to continue to live? Help, please, tell me what to do? What diagnosis can I have? How can I continue to live after a psychiatric hospital and is it worth it? Why live like this? Without a future, without education. What to do with what my mother drinks? I can’t accept such a life. (Please do not reassure me, “how beautiful this life ""etc.,) tell me what to do in such a situation",
1,. I don't want to absolutely live .. for two reasons:,
1,"In this life I want only one thing - to die. Every day, every second I dream about it. I had nothing good, I have never been happy in this life. Recently, I often wondered why? Why was I born at all? I'm just a bio-trash, damn loser. I no longer want to do anything, I don't need anything else from life, the years passed by.",
1,", I have read many stories, they mainly relate to social problems. I want to briefly tell my story, and how I get closer and closer to suicide. When I write, tears well up, because when I start to reflect, I understand how wretched I am. Most of my problems concern somatic (bodily) problems, and partly social ones. The bottom line is that since childhood I have been tormented by problems of the genital area, namely CONSTANT pain in the perineum, problems with urination, erection, etc. Was at many doctors, all they do is put cron. prostatitis, and after treatment shrug. Nothing helps, and in principle I already understand that this is not prostatitis at all, because all non-invasive studies demonstrate a normal prostate without inflammation, but this does not change the essence and I suffer in attempts to find the cause. Naturally, in addition to the pain that was exhausting me, such problems put pressure on the psyche, with girls, of course, there are also problems, as you understand. Well, okay, my next step on the way to self-drinking was the penis size complex (there's nothing to say, I'm not exaggerating, it really is much smaller than the average size, and does not fit into the physiological norm of size a little), but to be honest, for the most part I was complex at first, now it no longer plays such a role, you can live peacefully and engage in self-satisfaction. Oddly enough, after this stage, serious psychological problems began, which were reflected in the fact that I was looking for a bunch of problems in myself, thin bones, weight 60 kg, short stature, poor appearance, other chronic health problems, etc. Plus, of course, my character is such that everyone has me in life, in many ways I am too socialized, which does not give me my ""I"". Simply put, he always helped people and did not know how to refuse them. I also don't have much brains, no talents, I have not achieved anything in life. And so I came to the conclusion that in the future there are no prospects, a complete absence of social lifts, with a baggage of somatic and psychological problems, and every day of suffering. Every hour I always feel the strongest stress, which naturally only aggravates my condition in all its aspects.",
1,"I am 22 years old. Recently I was expelled from the medical institute. Before the institute I studied at 2 universities. Now I feel very bad, I wanted to recover in the second university, but the USE scores are no longer taken into account and I was not accepted.

1,"I can't study. The school atmosphere causes vicious itching in the nails. The environment there is so slippery and disgusting that it is impossible to wake up on a school day in the morning without crying. I'm tired of the crush and ""if you don't pass the exams, you won't go anywhere."" Tons of homework and zero reaction of teachers when you ask, but when, in fact, will they prepare us for the USE itself? I'm tired of hearing that I'm a lazy schmuck, because I put a bolt on all this study at school and I am actively preparing only for the subjects I am taking. It makes me shake that I don't have time to hand over my school debts and they accumulate every day. I will soon be breaking under the weight of it all. Anger and powerlessness goes into cut hands, which is why parents are increasingly ascertaining that ""this is all teenage"", not wanting to somehow get into the situation from the inside, from my side. Every day I go deeper and deeper into myself and the thought that in the end I will die anyway, and why, it seems, take care of anything and experience such severe stress - you can just part with life and everything will be over in an instant.",
1,"since childhood, I learned a lot of shit, while I was exemplary. everything was always bad. mother drank, father refused. I haven't eaten in weeks.

It was the edge. an investigation is underway at the moment, but he will not be jailed. he writes to my friends, throws pictures of how he raped me. everyone thinks I was going ... every day it gets worse and worse. there was already an attempt.

1,". I really ask you for help, advice, support ... because I was completely lost and I do not know how to continue to live so that my soul does not hurt. I am married, I have two small children, my husband is not their own father, but he adopted them as soon as they signed. In 2 months we will have a joint child, but it was during this period that life turned into a nightmare. The husband drinks (he was coded and broke), and when he gets drunk, then this is a terrible person. In the middle of the night he breaks down doors, makes fights, scares children. In his absence, at night men of a criminal kind were bursting, and I was shaking behind the flimsy doors and prayed to God to only hold out until morning. In the morning I gathered the children in an armful and ran to their parents. Parents' life is also not sugar, it is hard for them from such a large number of people, plus a small one will appear soon. Not without scandals. I love my husband no matter what, but it’s stupid, senseless and scary to return to the conditions he created. He won't stop drinking, and I just don't know what to do. I can't handle three children alone, parents will help, of course, but their possibilities are also not unlimited, plus they are really tired of us. I know that I need to live for the sake of children ... but how to live on when you feel yourself standing on the edge of an abyss ... you just want to commit suicide and disappear. My chest aches unbearably.",
1,"I drank a lot from the age of fifteen. I finished my vocational school with difficulty. Then I got drunk for short sober intervals and then I got alcohol again. I didn't work anywhere for a maximum of two months. , 5 years already I do not drink at all, neither on holidays nor on birthdays, I have excluded coffee, tea and cigarettes everything that can be over my head. I will never have a normal job, I barely found this, there will be no girl who needs a loader with such a past, besides, alcohol has badly affected my appearance. So I think it's worth it to live out a normal life anyway. will sometimes want to commit suicide",
1,"Good day, everyone. So from early childhood I was an ordinary guy. It all started at about 4 years old, when I suffered a very severe poisoning, which resulted in hyperkinesis. I remember how I was then at my grandmother, and I was lying and my mother was crying next to me, I don’t know what was happening to me. Then after 2 years my parents divorced, and strangely enough I still don’t know the reason for the divorce. For me it was a blow. I then just went to the first class and did not particularly fumble in the relations of my parents, but my mother took me to her upbringing + to all this I was brought up by my grandmother, but she interfered more when I came to visit her in the village, or when She came to us. I could meet with my father (we live nearby). School years passed brightly, it was interesting to study. When it was weekends, I went to my father on weekends, but there were times when my mother did not allow me, and then I was nervous. In 2010, dad found himself another woman who had a daughter (at the moment she is already under 30 years old, married, has a child). Relations with classmates were normal, I found friends. After school I went to college. At that time, many of my acquaintances, classmates and friends already had relationships with the opposite sex, but I spent more time studying, walking alone, or having fun after couples in Online Games. In the third year I fell into depression, but somehow I did not ask for help, I started running, horizontal bars, cycling. Although there was no mood, I pulled myself out by willpower. Then I still did not know what would happen next. In the summer of last year, when I worked in my specialty for the first time, I could not fully fulfill my assignments, which caused a serious scandal involving my parents. In short, they fired me, and I again fell into despondency, but this time neither horizontal bars nor running saved me, even if I had someone to talk to, it felt like everyone did not care about me. Already in the fall, I began to feel unnecessary in this world, my sleep was seriously disturbed (I could not sleep for 1-2 nights in a row). I accept now",
1,", I have a family problem, I never had a father. Mom was brought up harshly, and now I often get paid. Mom found a stepfather, we live in a one-room apartment, and now we live as the fourth in the same room: me, my younger sister, mom and he (on two sofas). He has been living with us for three years, during this time, I hated him with all my heart, not only did my mother pay less attention to the children, but he also thumps from time to time, beats my mother. Since we live in the same room, you can often hear everything at night, and I'm afraid to say that he walks around the apartment in his underpants, smokes, and then the whole apartment stinks. I used to be neutral towards him, but now I can't get along with him. Recently I quarreled with my mother very much, he climbed in, left me a bruise. Because of them, I often have thoughts of suicide, but I am a very religious person, and I do not let these thoughts take over. I pray constantly. I often began to quarrel with my mother. After the last quarrel, I moved to my grandmother, I miss home terribly, but as I remember the last quarrel, I start to think about death (my stepfather swore at me, my mother almost killed me) I know that my mother loves me, but she’s just very strict, and so am I. not a gift. Recently, my mother had a birthday, I apologized for my behavior, you could hear that she was bored, she was crying, but at the same time blamed me for everything.",

This is further aggravated by the fact that I cannot find a job, I have no money at all, I have nothing to pay for the apartment.

He was very smart and taught me a lot. And I myself was very active. She opened her first ""business"" at the age of 19. I had very big ambitions. There was no love, there was gratitude. He was everything to me. Teacher. I did not listen to what was said about him, I did not believe. Like a small child unaware of danger. Then I realized that he was a criminal, a swindler. And she wanted to leave. People who were not close to him were of no value - so, cannon fodder. So he just destroyed me. He concocted a criminal case sewn with white thread, hired a couple of drunks, maybe he gave bribes, I don't know for sure now. They put me in jail. They asked for 11 years for a fictional crime, gave 8.5. Then they took off for another two years. In total, I spent 4.5 years in prison, and I left early.

1,", my name is Arisha. I am 13 years old on May 4, I will be 14. I really want to die. Recently, everything has become very bad. In the 8th grade, I specifically slipped through my studies, my ancestors yell at you all the time, and they don't listen to you at all when you want something I don't like myself, I try to love, but I can't. I have a sister with whom we often quarrel, I try to find common contact with her, but she pushes me away. Then my mother says that I start arguing with her first. It even happens to me for this and beats. I can not say anything to anyone. I can not keep secret with someone. Of the boys, I always fall in love with those who have a girlfriend, and those who shit you. I cannot keep a personal diary. .. to his sister reads all the time and tells everything to mom. I already tried to commit suicide. It did not work. I often imagine my death, how my mother wants to treat me like that, I often imagine the death of people close to me. 1 semester I finished very badly. Mom started yelling at me. She said: you could come up to me for advice, ask for help, we could hire you a tutor. So what? What would happen? I approached her only she yelled at me with the words you don't even want to think with your head! I had a very happy childhood, toys, amusement parks, I was pampered, I went to a good kindergarten, studied in a good school from the 1st to the 5th grade. Then we moved to Kazakhstan for family reasons. I was transferred to a good school. .On my first school day in KAZAKHSTAN it was terrible. I came home from school all in tears, but my mother just yelled at me to pull myself together, and this is instead of support. I studied in Kazakhstan for 2 years. Then we came back (where I am I studied from 1st to 5th grade) and so I told everything. I sometimes think that I'm crazy. Help me please. Yes, I want to die. But I realize that my family will feel bad after my death.",
1,"! I don't want to live because of my illness. Although in appearance everyone will say that she is healthy. The sore is very ashamed, fecal incontinence has already been for six months. This is how I've been living in hell for six months, the doctors don't really help. Every day in a terrible depression, I do not sleep at all at night. Some thoughts only about suicide, because life with this sore is over. I live only for my parents. In general, these thoughts from the age of 14, I regret that then it did not come to this, there would be no such torment. Then, at 14, my classmates hounded me. Then everything seemed to work out. But all the same, I felt flawed all the time, not like normal people. Communication was always difficult. Despite this, 2 years ago there was even one guy, but in the end he left me. And he also infected me with diseases. Since then, I decided not to build relationships at all, all the more who needs me both physically with diseases and morally with my withdrawn character. I can't find a common language with people, I don't know what to say, I don't understand jokes, I take everything literally. I think I’m a little autistic. Appearance also cheated God. Well, now there is also incontinence to boot! I already had a hard time finding the meaning of living, and now I don’t see anything at all happy, I don’t see any gap in life. If before there was at least some hope for the future, now there’s no hope at all. All my life with so-so perspective",

But I have to endure stress all the time, no one ever takes me seriously. After the army, I have not worked for 3 years. They do not take anything, due to lack of work experience, and where experience is not important, they do not take me, because they do not perceive for an adult because of my teenage appearance (for example, a security guard). Plus, I can’t do anything with my hands, my father died early, so he didn’t teach me anything male, and in fact, my hands grow out of the wrong place. I wanted to stay in the army. under the contract, and here it turned out to be not suitable, it turns out that there is a problem with the heart and thyroid gland, although I was fit for military service. Girls are also a huge problem. I get to know them easily, but no one wants me as a man. For my whole life there was only a couple girls in an intimate sense, and then, it turns out there were those who did not really care who to sleep with. It was the relationship with anyone. The girls say that you are a good guy, but we don’t want you. From this all the question, why live? An unemployed, helpless 25th guy who does not give no woman? I keep asking God why I am all this? Okay, one thing. But how so? God deprived of growth, appearance, talent and elementary skills and health. Because of all this, problems with alcohol and drugs began I constantly get involved in terrible stories. Only by a miracle, they have not been killed or imprisoned in the last couple of years ...

But the strangest thing is that even with an overdose of medications, nothing happened .. The dose was fatal, but it was not possible to die ... Nothing happened. As if something does not start up.

1,"Hey. I am 17 years old. I want to commit suicide. I look like a pretty and cheerful girl, I have many fans. My mother always reproached me with everything, comparing me to my older sister. My elder sister is ideal: she graduated from high school for a gold medal, university for a red diploma, she is all beautiful, she never upset her mother, did not deceive her. I studied well at school, I had 3 A's, but I deceived my parents and said that I was an excellent student, because I did not want to be worse than my older sister. I entered the medical university in the targeted direction at the age of 16. It was very difficult for me to study and after 1 year I was expelled. I really couldn't handle all this stuff. Mother considers me a complete failure and says that she does not need such a child and that I should go and hang myself. Considers me his punishment. She says if I can't study it would be better to go to prostitutes or sell herself to someone. My father drinks. I haven't seen him for two months. I understand that no one needs it. Today, after another scandal, my mother, as always, said that it would have been better if I hadn't been and why she was punished in the form of me and told her to go hang. I promised her that I will. Then she yelled at me and told me not to scare her with my words. Then after 10 minutes she told me that if I did something with myself, she would curse me. Because she doesn't want to embarrass herself in front of other people. Because my older sister is single, she doesn't need such a shame. Again about my sister. She doesn't care about me. If someone has read this far, thank you very much, I really don't have anyone to talk to. I have a lot of acquaintances and no friends. I decided. I will commit suicide.

Here I live and do not know what to do, my wife says that I am an intelligent and educated person, I can give good advice and people listen to these advice, they consider me a normal person and worthy to ask advice, in return I do not consider myself as such and I consider it a complete failure.

1,". It would seem that the topic is ordinary and typical. But I'm already on the edge, and I'm tired. I literally ""collapse"" as a person. I feel like an ugly and defective person. That everything with me is not like people. I am 18 years old, and I thought that having entered the university, everything would change, but no, everything continues, maybe even worse. I just do not like myself, and only at home can I exist more or less calmly. Ever since school, I did not fit into the beauty standards of local beauties, and was always upset that I had such a specific appearance. No one got to know me so violently, and guys in society don't notice me. And if I communicate with someone, I am afraid to look at the person, it seems to me that he thinks badly of my face. I hate taking pictures and start hysteria when they take pictures of me. I don't see any advantages in my appearance, and I always compare myself with a certain type. I’m not being paid attention to, and I feel obsessed with it. Recently I found a diary that I wrote at the age of 16, it is literally all ""saturated"" with pain and self-loathing. I feel very bad, recently thoughts of suicide often appear, I am tired of fighting alone, only my parents are with me, but they swear and say that I am normal and they just drive up the price. But everything is very serious for me and things are reaching a dead end. I am losing my personality, I began to speak indistinctly and it is difficult for me to connect even a couple of words (although before I could maintain a conversation even with adults) ... I am afraid to make grimaces and walk with a stone face, because in emotions it is even worse. It's so hard for me, I want to give it up .... I climb, I climb, but I fall back into this hole. And no one is around, from my peers who could support me and get me out of this state, there was a friend, but she left too ... now I am alone ... with self-loathing .... I just can't look in the mirror even to look, what can we say about dating ... maybe I've already erased myself that my presence is not even noticed. I went to a psychologist, but her visualization techniques did not help me. I do not know what to do!!! I tried to lure myself into business and hobbies, but it becomes easier for me while I'm at home, and outside everything starts anew. What should I do? How to get out? It’s very hard for me, and I don’t know how to help myself. Sorry for the abundance of text and mistakes.",
1,"How much I hate myself. For almost 5 years everything was fine at school, but now what? Now, no matter what middle class I got into, they saw me as a worthless asshole and a dog! After at least 5-6 days I will be 15, and it’s better not to get it every day. I liked a classmate like her, I have not yet seen, dear, with a cheerful face and even clothes suitable for her. I wanted to talk to her, it's clear to hell, I ignored it, wrote through my brother. She added my brother and me to the emergency (Indeed, why talk to the one who got the Grade ""Loch"" in the class?)! When I spoke to her through her brother's account, she said that she knows me well (but in fact she doesn’t know anything at all). She thinks that she sees me for 2 3 years, which means she knows me well, God, what nonsense! Probably all will come to the fact that I will soon end all this suffering! And I'm not going to live with passion for her!",
1,"Я больше не могу...Еще со школы был самым слабым в классе и не мог дать сдачи,потом родители захотели сделать меня военным и после 8 класса решили отправить в военное училище,где из-за моего слабого духа и характера меня часто били и издевались. Уже тогда на каникулах у меня были мысли все это закончить и прекратить мучения.Кое-как,вытерпев 3 года,я выпустился,но мне предстояло учиться еще 5 лет,перенеся столько душевных мук и лишений,мне хотелось только одного-на волю.Все это время показалось мне тюремным заключением. Не выдержав,написал рапорт об отчислении из военного ВУЗа еще на первом месяце;отец после этого начинает меня ненавидеть. Но дальше становится только хуже,через пару лет отцу дали квартиру,мы переехали из родного села в город,там у меня не было ни друзей ни знакомых,отчего я просто не знал с кем даже поговорить.Через год наше село сносят подчистую,там ведется грандиозная стройка,ничего не остается,кроме изображений в памяти,куда я могу вернуться.Тут мать разводится с отцом и тот через полгода находит себе новую женщину,его словно подменяют. У нас ежедневно ссоры,иногда доходит до драки,через день он заходит ко мне в комнату и по несколько часов начинает рассказывать про мою ущербность и бесполезность моей на тот момент учебы в университете,постоянно с ненавистью говорит,что я неблагодарный урод,который не захотел учиться  военном вузе,забирает ключи от дома,не разрешает пользоваться бытовой техникой и пр.Когда у него выходной,мне приходится бродить по городу с самого утра до ночи,чтоб избежать ссор. На тот момент я уже подрабатывал на полставки на складе и покупал все необходимое себе сам,платя за квартиру. После окончания учебы меня забирают в армию(там ужасы военного учили и издевательства повторяются опять),после чего он выгоняет меня из квартиры,найдя работу,я начинаю снимать жилье с другом,еще через пару лет нахожу неплохую работу,начинаю постепенно откладывать деньги и забываю о прошлых ужасах,первой целью решил накопить денег на небольшое авто,откладывал почти год...и тут мне звонят судебные приставы и сообщают,что с моего счета сняты все деньги в счет моего отца(оплата коммуналки),который решил,что ему мало пенсии военного офицера и тех денег,которые он получает еще и работая. Тогда моя маленькая мечта разбилась...дальше он вообще стал подавать на выселение и постоянно выписывать мне счета через суд,наслаждаясь жизнью с новой женой. Все попытки поговорить заканчиваются гневом,упреками о моем отчислении из военного ВУЗа,иногда опять доходит до драк...Еще через пару месяцев на работе происходит чудовищное сокращение людей и понижение з.п. почти в 3 раза,как результат:после увольнения в годы кризиса, полгода не могу найти работу,с каждым днем меня все больше и больше посещают мысли,что я ни на что не годен,особенно после очередного собеседования,куда меня не берут.Желание наконец все это закончить сильнее с каждым днем.Однако,мне все же удается найти ее. Сейчас мне 28 лет,из-за съемного жилья денег почти не остается,девушка у меня была очень давно,практически всю жизнь я чувствую себя одиноким,с мамой тоже особо не вяжется,она живет отдельно. Сколько бы не говорили,что все еще впереди, почти 10 лет не могу никого найти,недавно влюбился в женщину,которая на 5 лет старше меня,решил с ней пообщаться,но она сказала,что у нее муж и ребенок;сердце болит,ничего не могу с этим поделать. В очередной раз подтверждаюсь,что со мной не все в порядке и точно ущербный и никчемный биомусор,чья жизнь это одни страдания и боль. Более 5 лет представляю себя покончившим с собой <ред.мод.> в разных местах,мое воображение постоянно рисует картинки,лежащего себя мертвым.Я больше так не могу и не хочу,не вижу никакого предназначения и смысла жизни,для чего жить?для чего весь этот цирк?что со мной не так?Бессчетное количество раз я молился Господу: умолял его,чтобы он забрал мою жизнь,что меня сбила машина,застрелил наркоман,зарезал вор и пр. но так ничего и не сбылось за все это время,почему?ПОЧЕМУ,Господи?Разве я так много прошу у тебя?Каждый день как каторга,но я больше так не могу,больше так продолжаться не может. Я так и не понял одной просто вещи: для чего живут другие люди?что может держать их так сильно в этой проклятой жизни?РАДИ ЧЕГО ОНИ БОРЮТСЯ?",
1,"I am almost 23 years old. Soon my birthday, I have a bachelor's degree, I have been living with a girl for almost 2 years. Everything would be fine, but for half a year I was looking for a job, since I have a weak heart, I can only work with my head. Naturally, there were a lot of scandals with the girl ... the debt in the apartment hangs, the loan hangs. And now hurray, they accepted me and tomorrow the first working day ... but there is no agreement or at least someone to borrow money for the same road (since I live outside the city). My parents live their own lives, there is no point in even asking for help. A couple of friends, but while I went to interviews - I hired. Money money money. Almost every day we gnaw with a girl. She was tired, I was tired of everything ... tired of getting out from childhood, understanding everything, surviving, waiting ... from the age of 18 I think to finish everything. It seems that the guy is also smart, but what other people get at once, I have to pull it out with my teeth. My favorite pancake has not even given flowers for a year, since everything goes away at once ... her parents, to put it mildly, dislike me. I want to be quiet, and so as not to interfere with anyone, not to piss off, not to humiliate myself ... or to pack up things, go to a light bar, and bother ... the main thing is to be sure to be nailed, otherwise I will wake up crippled - as if I’ll crash myself.",
1,"My name is Anna, I am 25 years old. There are 2 children. 2 boys (2 and 4 years old). With my husband I am currently in the divorce proceedings. There is no other man. And unforeseen. I liked one guy. He was making himself so positive. And how he got his (sex), so he began to show his real I. We rarely communicate now. And we communicate in general due to the fact that he is a friend of my brother. My husband is generally a STRANGE MAN. The person who beat me, cheated, lived to die, etc. , now does not want a divorce. He believes that we will try, calls me every day, talks about his trips to women, about where he drank and drank drugs, and if I send him, he starts telling me that I am no one, that I am a log, scary and hysterical. That nobody needs me. And at the same time he says that all this he says and does out of great love for me !!! And recently, a misfortune happened in my family. My 75 year old grandmother broke her hip. And for almost half a year I have been sitting with her. I had to move in with her, leave my apartment and live in a house with people who do not appreciate human labor at all. I hesitated to listen to some complaints. But I can't leave my grandmother either. Although she herself had already begun to get out of her mind. And her requests reach the point that they are more like mockery. I cannot arrange children in a kindergarten. One is still small, the second goes, but paid. (9000r) I receive child benefits 2000r. Parents help, of course, very helpful. But they live far from me. And they cannot support me. Children don't listen to me. And everyone makes comments to me about the fact that I don't do them. But I don't have time to deal with them properly. It seems to me that I am in a hole, 4 meters deep and cannot get out of it. What a hopelessness. I have long ceased to belong to myself and cannot manage my life. I do whatever they tell me. Like a dog. I have terrible thoughts of committing suicide. And what is even worse is to take your children with you. I'm scared and bitter.",
1,"I have been treated by a psychiatrist for ten years, and have been on disability for five years. The diagnosis of schizophrenia. I already wrote a request for help on this site several years ago, but then everything was not so bad. In recent years I have been living in the daily fear of death. I am afraid to read the news when I see the words ""nuclear weapons"", ""climate change"", etc., the fear just goes off scale. I am afraid to look into the sky - suddenly I will see an asteroid approaching the planet or a nuclear rocket. I understand the inadequacy of my fear, but I can’t help myself. Any unpleasant sensation in the body, indisposition - the thought that I may be terminally ill. Everyone is looking forward to Easter with joy, and I - with horror. After all, they say that if the blessed fire does not come down, it will mean the approach of the end of the world. Two months before Easter, but I already have obsessive thoughts on this topic. But the worst thing is the side effects of the medication I am taking. Every day, and on some days almost constantly, I have strange pulling sensations, twitching in the face and other parts of the body. For a long time, three years, but the further - the worse. Doctors say that this is a side effect of an antipsychotic and cannot be treated, and you need to get used to these sensations. But I am not vaccinated against tetanus as I have been allergic since childhood. I know that tetanus starts with spasms of the facial muscles. And now, several times a day, when these sensations begin, I feel scared - am I really dying !!! Because of this, it is scary even to stay at home alone for half an hour. I live with an elderly mother, it's scary to think what will happen to me after her death. Living in eternal fear is unbearable. In general, I do not tolerate antipsychotics, it is unlikely that it will be possible to replace the drug, since I have tried a bunch of drugs, the rest are even worse. And without the pills, clear acute psychosis develops quickly. I have been in a mental hospital several times, but they cannot help, the disease is still gradually progressing. Plus to this - abulia - a pathological decrease in willpower. It is not always possible to force yourself to do a wet cleaning in your room or even brush your teeth. All attempts to change your life, even the elementary beginning of the morning with a five-minute physical exercise, end within three days.",

1," dear readers. My life flies in hellish torment. Every day I wake up with a reluctance to live. This is a feeling that cannot really be conveyed. There is a heaviness in my soul. I do not understand what is happening around, I seemed to be lost. It began after parting with a loved one. In short, I'll tell you about the past: since childhood, I lived in a dysfunctional and large family. I always felt a sense of constraint, shy, not. Self-confidence, I thought that my life was an illusion, like a dream of some kind, I thought it would all end, I was not responsible for my life with one phrase !!! I did not fight, but went with the flow. Everything was decided for me, I avoided problems. I didn't live my life. You know, maybe it's stupid, but I didn't live for myself, but for someone else. He was very noble. I tried to please everyone. I did not offend anyone. I did good, all that was in my power. I myself did not develop as a person. There were many fears, and I did not understand why. Now, after this trauma, memory has worsened, absent-mindedness, and, as it were, isolation. I don’t know what to do. Every day I comprehend everything, I look for solutions, I think that I try. I go to meet my fears. But it doesn’t work. That girl who left me and cheated on me , I loved her very much, and I still love her. I myself am to blame for her betrayal, because I incited her to do this, because of my lack of confidence, because of jealousy and ignorance. But I really did not know how to be, how to love, how to respect how to keep, I didn’t know a lot of things. Having lost I understood. Say this is an experience, no, this is the end of love. I can’t love anyone anymore, I never feel lonely at the same time. It’s impossible with others, and somehow I got confused in everything. I thought to change my life, start differently. I worked all my life at a construction site, I decided to change my job to a car dealer. It was difficult to succeed. And not long ago, I learned that my former beloved was pregnant, again stress, and hellish pain, The fact is that when we were together we tried to make children, but it did not work because of her health, but it did. even though she says that she loves me, but fate does not allow us to be together. And that evening he got drunk and got behind the wheel. Rights were deprived, a car was taken away, a fine, they were fired from work, and friends, too, since they were responsible for They turned me away from me. Everything is bad with my family, too, from early childhood I was ashamed of them, for their way of life, not prudishness, not responsibility, idleness, but there is no point in condemning them, they are not chosen. And it turned out to be a vicious circle. everything is bad at home, there is no work, there is no confidence to find it, there is no way of communicating with people, low self-esteem, I don’t know how. In a word, vegetables. No goals, no desire, nothing. And it lasts a long time. No books or sports are interesting. I look at everyone and understand how lucky everyone was. They tried to do something, fought, and I flew the lapukh somewhere in the clouds. 25 years I just threw it away. And instead of a heavy load in the form of harsh reality. I pray the Lord to give me the strength to cope with everything , even though he gave the slightest sign of where to go, but he doesn't hear me",

I understand that my reason for why I wrote here will not be as significant as for others, but, nevertheless, it prevents me from enjoying life and makes me periodically think about suicide. I understand that everyone has their own cockroaches and problems in their heads, and this is not a reason to give up. But I've already dropped it. Until the age of 14, everything was fine. I grew up as a smart, purposeful, active person. I developed my personal qualities. And at one moment something clicked in my head, and personal extinction began. Activity and purposefulness were replaced by passivity and indifference to absolutely everything. It can be compared to a computer, at first it functions normally, and then viruses enter its system that kill it from the inside. Naturally, I also had quite serious reasons. I broke down and broke down. Then he gradually recovered, but the former enthusiasm and cheerfulness did not return. I became a completely different person. What do I have in my 18 years - nothing. I am completely alone, and as stupid as it sounds, I like it, because I have come to terms with loneliness. But, a lonely person is doomed to a mental disaster, which is now happening to me. I cannot be in society for a long time, it tires me. I have become indifferent to the death of loved ones, nothing interests me, I just need to spend most of my time alone. I hate love relationships, because I believe that love as such, except biological, does not exist. I do not believe in God. I am struggling with myself, with my inner contradictions alone, and this does not bring results. Hands dropped, but no one to raise, because a loved one is not around, I don't get along with people, there is no faith. And the strength is already running out. Well, that's all.

No matter how much I tried to create a relationship, everyone says ""you are just a friend and nothing more"" or just say ""nothing will happen between us"" when they find out that I have a hearing aid. I didn't want to live either. I like one girl ... I love her and she knows it, because I told her this from the bottom of my heart, but I'm supposedly a ""friend"" to her anyway. I understood why none of the girls want a relationship with me, although I am a normal guy. I'm in grade 11. I even put myself in order, that is, I lost weight. In childhood, they also teased, called names ... Remembering my childhood, I begin to cry a lot, even now I cry while I write. Yes, my hearing fell due to antibiotics when I was 8 months old. I don't know what else to say ... I began to understand philosophy, began to understand what some people do not understand: what chaos is going on in life. ""Several knives in my back were left in me ..."" That girl with whom I am trying to establish a relationship is very rare in quality: beautiful, kind, understanding, caring and so on. I hope that you will understand me too ... How hard it is in my soul now, how hard it is to undertake something. Since childhood, I have been a very reserved person, and now it is 50/50.

Until recently, as a teenager, I tried to find a way out of my situation: I tried to cope with depression that has been bothering me for several years with rare periods of ""respite"".

1,"Нет собственно никакой истории: детство провел на рыбалке, чем был вполне доволен. Дача, школа, спиннинг. В 12-13 лет захотелось общения, прилип к отморозкам, закурил, запил. Дача, школа, алкоголь. Закончил школу, поставил цель. Цель, колледж, алкоголь. Ребята во дворе советовали мне обзавестись подружкой, но меня это совсем не интересовало. После я ушел в армию, где по сути впервые в жизни тесно столкнулся с социумом: (Сами понимаете, не самое лучшее время и место). Вернулся, погулял по городу, неделю, другую, шлепнул пива, на следующий день опять и опять, и опять. Поступил во 2й колледж, Пары, дача алкоголь. Меня бесило что меня в упор никто не видит, я понимал что это из-за того, что я ни с кем не общался. Ни то что бы я интроверт, просто я их не понимаю. Мыслей у меня много интересных и разных, а вот говорить не о чем. Прошел слух, что я умственно-отсталый, т.к. был неразговорчив, редко появлялся, носил что попало и всегда с похмелья. Но я опроверг это. Я сменил гардероб, обзавелся леденцами и пришел на сессию, и сдал ее лучше всех. Ни то что бы я что-то учил, просто первый раз в жизни всерьез воспринял учебу, причем обучение проходило так: 5л пива и конспект написан, и отложен в память, я его даже не повторял. От скуки стал читать книжки, классику, психологию, политические сводки. Приходил в столовую где все трещат без умолку, подсаживался за разные столики, и нигде не было такой темы которую бы я мог поддержать. Мне ведь все равно: ((где и почем она купила эти сапожки, где он подцепил девочку, какая часть звездных войн лучше, почему препод по философии не женат, и.т.д.)) Так прошел второй колледж. Поступил я теперь на вышку я на 5-7 лет старше всех и теперь они меня все просто выматывают своей детскостью и тупой наивностью. Я конечно-же знаю что нужно делать. От своей цели я за все это время не отказался и работал над ней. Сейчас вижу, что не справляюсь с ней. А делать нужно следующее: С 1 января я уже не пьющий человек(не зашитый, просто надоело) Съехать наконец от родителей, которые мне до чертиков надоели своей опекой, Устроиться на работу, найти девушку и гулять с ней в общественных местах. И с этого момента начинается когнитивный диссонанс: 1-т.к. я студент, у меня нет возможности работать на нормальной работе, а на иных заработках я не смогу себе позволить ничего из этого. 2-Что бы найти девушку, нужно хоть немного понимать чем живут все эти люди. 3-От современных фильмов у меня ""изжога"", современная музыка - это вообще нельзя считать музыкой(утверждаю как музыкант), коньки и ролики даже вблизи никогда не видел, и.т.п. И куда мне с этой девушкой? В лес за грибами? на рыбалку? на дачу? Или сидя дома на стуле рассказывать ей что свет от солнца до земли идет 8 минут? А если вдруг секс? А если в клуб потащит? Да и вообще сначала как-то познакомиться надо))) А знакомиться для чего? Для семьи-нет, т.к. если моя цель сдвинется с места, мне не до семьи будет. Если просто для совместного времяпровождения, то вообще не вижу смысла, панически боюсь секса, никуда не хожу... Такие вот противоречия уже больше месяца вращаются в голове. По хорошему, мне нужно бросить свою цель, но во первых: это мне не гарантирует перемен, во вторых жалко бросать работу в которой я за столько лет так далеко продвинулся. Продолжать не буду, потому, что уже начинаю круги замыкать. Так и вытекает одно из другого. Говорю себе, все! хватит анализа! Просто действуй. Иду на кухню, наливаю кофе, делаю круг по квартире и задаю себе вопрос: а что собственно делать??? И понеслась опять вся эта канитель причин и следствий...  Ни то что бы я думал о суициде, но мысль о том, что жить бессмыслено - меня иногда посещает.",

I was an ordinary good boy, after school I entered a technical school, and then it started: first drugs, while I did not sit idly by, I started with doctors: narcologists, psychologists, psychotherapists, rehabilitation centers, 6-7 different times. Since we are Orthodox people with him, then another plus to all this, churches, monasteries, holy places, holy springs, prayers, molebens, communions, unction, lecture by German Chesnokov in the Trinity-Sergius Lavra, visited with him Elder Ianiky in Chesakovo , my daily motherly prayers, in general, I do not know what else to do, only my 33-year-old son has also become a bitter drunkard. More than a month of a sober life can not stand, he drinks, and besides, he is addicted to one lek. drug (ed. mod).

I suffer a lot, seeing all this, and not only me, but also my 88 year old mother, I also worry about her that in old age she has no peace. Many times thoughts of suicide came, I even prepared everything I needed, the only thing that holds back is that I need to take care of my mother, and I do not feel sorry for myself at all, it seems that then all my problems will go away, at least I will not see them. And how many all kinds of conversations were conducted with him: and that I love him very much, and that he is very dear to me, and that we will overcome everything and win, etc. All in vain, and another terrible thought crept in - it would be better if he were not , buried, cried, and slowly would begin to live again.

In general, the situation was such in my youth there was a head injury, and then a microstroke and after that they developed severe persistent headaches that did not give in to any treatment. These pains can be relieved only by analgesics of a certain composition, which our authorities transferred to prescriptions in early 2012 and turned the prescriptions into a real nightmare for patients exhausted from pain. I applied wherever possible - the answer is one pain does not heal, live and suffer and do not see any lumen at all, just as my close relatives do not understand me and there is no and never was any support and no sympathy and understanding from them. I am also tormented by the sharpest mental pain why in our society they regret, help and lick and blow dust off adults with colds, ""dying"" at 37.5 and so beastly treat people suffering from severe headaches. And even before, when I was sick with colds, my mother also never spared and did not regret and often did not believe me + also me, and this adds to the sharpest mental pain. I am tired of the severe exhausting pain and the inability to relieve it, and I want to commit suicide from the fact that I no longer see any lumen or exit in this dead-end situation for me.

The fact that I went to work is good, but what I did before, I can’t, I have no feelings, communication with clients, too. Simple conversations cannot be maintained in my head. I’ve moved away from my granddaughter and loved ones, because I don’t feel close, which was before. In general, empathy for people has disappeared. If I do something, then I do not get satisfaction, it is not present anywhere. In short, I am in Hell and God does not help me, now I lost faith in him.

1,"Good afternoon. All the problems started a long time ago. Since childhood, I practically had no friends, my mother was always unhappy that I had such a temperament, and indeed my appearance. From early childhood, I was intimidated with whatever was possible - if you always do not study well, do not do this or that, then we will expel, take everything away and so on ... Mother believed that friends are not necessary, that you can do without them, that you need to do homework every day and night, read books. But I love to read the literature of the XIX-XX centuries and read it with pleasure. As a child, I saw how a man was hit to death by a car, saw blood on the road, and besides, I was very impressionable then. I saw a man fall from the 15th floor ... Once I was even dragged into an abandoned house, when I was walking alone next to this house, and they began to torture me with a knife, but I managed to run away with small cuts, and did not say anything to anyone, because it was very scary. But now I am no longer impressionable, as I have seen many similar things in my life. I am bullied on the Internet for my words, for my appearance, even for my religious affiliation. Former friends said that religion is a mistake, it's a problem for everyone, but I thought differently and because of this they teased me. I always studied perfectly well, until I started smoking and drinking alcohol. You can say that I am so bad, and so on ... But sometimes I helped the disabled, giving my earned money to help them. And he did this many times, because he understood that they needed money more than me. Because of smoking, a strong addiction developed, although no one smokes in the family, and I smoked in order to die as soon as possible ... Yes, maybe the impetus for this was the collapse of the family, the death of many loved ones, and just life by the age of 11-12 became more gray meaningless. From the age of 11, thoughts of suicide never cease to enter my head. I have an IQ of 140, but just how much happiness did I get from it? Recently they stole 10,000 rubles, honestly earned. I wanted to become a physician, as I am more inclined towards biology and chemistry, and similar sciences in general. For many years my parents have been saying that I am not good for anywhere, that I am a vegetable, nobody wants to go to hell. But I wrote 2 trial OGE - everything for 2-3, and I was preparing for the trial, although I am still studying at 4-5, and because of this teacher, and everyone began to get even stronger, I generally doubt how I will write the rest exams, and how will I pass the main OGE, not to mention the USE, because my mother demands that I go to grade 10 ... But the classmates whom I helped all year, they just used me and wrote a test for 4-5, I am still shocked by the betrayal ... People are simply cheeky using my kindness ... I don't have a father ... Now most people have become such corrupt and terrible creatures (sorry for the expression) that they laugh at the disabled, laugh at death man, for the sake of money are ready to do everything in the world. I have a running depression, I just don't know what to do, I'm stumped ... And another trial is coming soon, and I'm just in shock. It's just that when I come to the exam, I start to get nervous and remember all the bad things, because I have not slept for several nights and cannot forgive a lot ... And obsessive thoughts come straight. Help, please, if you can ... I just want to believe when all this stops, even though life is unfair, but still ...",

I am very ashamed in front of my family, as I always close myself, never make contact. Even when they go to meet me. I'm scared to talk, scared to be myself. So I just avoid possible meetings, conversations - everything. I closed myself off from everyone. I'm very tired. It's so hard for me to live with it. I just don't want to. All life is a struggle. I tried a lot to work on myself, to develop, to overcome problems. But, apparently, the result is very small, since I am writing here again. I often think about doing something to myself. <method of suicide - ed. mod.> Sometimes I am afraid that in a state of passion I will do things, but I can no longer fix it.

1,"Good afternoon! Cry of the soul, for a long time I can not find a way out of the situation. I got into debt bondage. I was collecting money for a car, my mother asked to borrow money for her boss and just borrow it, but at interest. There was no limit to the joy of additional income. Because I myself raised my daughter without a husband, my mother, being retired, also has a meager income, Her son - my brother is also my dependents. Expenses are growing every day, and, alas, it is difficult to increase income in a situation of financial crisis. After a while, this woman needed another amount. So the amount of debt has grown over a million. The agreement was that, if necessary, the children will return, if I ask two weeks in advance. There were personal questions, about the cause of the bypassed page of funds, I took loans. The amount of my loans exceeded the amount owed to me, the situation at work worsened. The salary is not enough to pay off loans, she has to borrow from friends. Today, a one-room apartment in a mortgage, a domestic car on credit. The debt is not repaid. The bank is overdue for two cordites. Borrowers also ask for money back. There is no money to buy bread. For two years the meaning of life has been lost. One goal: to find money to pay the next payment to the bank. Outwardly, it has aged ten years. Cry from the heart, there is no one to turn to. Tell me what to do? I'm not afraid of work, but no work!

My father can't get a job and sits on my neck. My sister doesn't go to school either. Since he refuses to go to school in our city. He also refuses to live with his mother and her new husband. I want to say that due to the fact that my mother was large-scaled on a loan without intermediaries, she completely lost her ability to reason. Her speech and actions speak of the lack of intelligence as such. My father, too, has not been able to find a job for more than 3 years, has become carried away by all kinds of esotericism, and, honestly, I am already scared to deal with him and even talk.

I have no children and a husband, too. I am very lonely now and thoughts are not good in I even lay in a neurosis clinic, I take antidepressant pills, but it does not help me. It hurts my soul very much and it seems to me that it will never end. I pray in the morning and in the evening and go to church, but it helps a little. What am I desperate to do.

1,". I wrote here half a year ago, but the situation has not changed, and it has become even worse, which prevents me from living an ordinary life. I am 23 years old and have been suffering from acne for 10 years in a row. The thing is, I am infected with eye and facial demodex. I underwent 2 courses of Roaccutane, at first I drank for 8 months, and on the second I sat on these expensive pills for a whole year. But the improvements were only for half a year, and then everything was repeated. I am in complete despair, I have been following the food for as long as 4 years, I do not allow eating harmful products, I follow the hygiene of my face, I have stopped masturbating for a week, but nothing has changed. Because of these pills, I greatly spoiled my health. As you understand there is no personal life, never even held a girl's hand. I'm tired of hiding and hiding my illness all the time. I don't know why God tests me like that. I spend a lot of money on useless treatment, I can't look at these doctors, none of them can help me. I love and really appreciate my loved ones who have always helped me, but living like that is also very difficult. In a week I have a dissertation defense, I think after the defense I will already finish this matter, since I do not see the point in my existence. Apparently I once angered God very much, since He hates me so much. In general, I don't see my future, because I have little faith in healing, I think I won't have a family, because instinctively girls always choose a strong and healthy male for procreation, I somehow don't fit into this society.

1,. It's very hard for me. I feel completely unnecessary.,
1," dear readers. My life flies in hellish torment. Every day I wake up with a reluctance to live. This is a feeling that cannot really be conveyed. There is a heaviness in my soul. I do not understand what is happening around, I seemed to be lost. It began after parting with a loved one. In short, I'll tell you about the past: since childhood, I lived in a dysfunctional and large family. I always felt a sense of constraint, shy, not. Self-confidence, I thought that my life was an illusion, like a dream of some kind, I thought it would all end, I was not responsible for my life with one phrase !!! I did not fight, but went with the flow. Everything was decided for me, I avoided problems. I didn't live my life. You know, maybe it's stupid, but I didn't live for myself, but for someone else. He was very noble. I tried to please everyone. I did not offend anyone. I did good, all that was in my power. I myself did not develop as a person. There were many fears, and I did not understand why. Now, after this trauma, memory has worsened, absent-mindedness, and, as it were, isolation. I don’t know what to do. Every day I comprehend everything, I look for solutions, I think that I try. I go to meet my fears. But it doesn’t work. That girl who left me and cheated on me , I loved her very much, and I still love her. I myself am to blame for her betrayal, because I incited her to do this, because of my lack of confidence, because of jealousy and ignorance. But I really did not know how to be, how to love, how to respect how to keep, I didn’t know a lot of things. Having lost I understood. Say this is an experience, no, this is the end of love. I can’t love anyone anymore, I never feel lonely at the same time. It’s impossible with others, and somehow I got confused in everything. I thought to change my life, start differently. I worked all my life at a construction site, I decided to change my job to a car dealer. It was difficult to succeed. And not long ago, I learned that my former beloved was pregnant, again stress, and hellish pain, The fact is that when we were together we tried to make children, but it did not work because of her health, but it did. even though she says that she loves me, but fate does not allow us to be together. And that same evening he got drunk and got behind the wheel. They turned me away from me. Everything is bad with my family, too, from early childhood I was ashamed of them, for their way of life, not ruthlessness, not responsibility, idleness, but there is no point in condemning them, they are not chosen. And it turned out to be a vicious circle. everything is bad at home, there is no job, there is no confidence to find it, there is no way of communicating with people, low self-esteem, I don’t know how. In a word, vegetables. No goals, no desire, nothing. And it lasts a long time. No books or sports are interesting. I sit only I look at everyone and understand how lucky everyone was. They tried to do something, fought, and I flew the lapukh somewhere in the clouds. 25 years I just threw it away. And instead of a heavy load in the form of a harsh reality. I pray the Lord to give me the strength to cope with everything , even though he gave the slightest sign of where to go, but he doesn't hear me. I read about people like me on the Internet, and I get upset (without nye, degradation, losers, etc.) my future is either death in the near future, or I will become a homeless person",

Sometimes it seems to me that she is going crazy. 5 years ago she stopped leaving the house. He only goes to the store to buy food, but at home he mostly sleeps or just lies in bed. If I do at least something neither the way she said or not the way she wanted to, she immediately starts screaming and calling me names. Mom constantly manipulates and blackmails me. Takes away the phone, doesn't give money for clothes, if I don't do as she says. If, for example, I have not washed the dishes, then she puts them in my room. I tried to somehow reach out to her, explain that her behavior hurts me, she says that I do not deserve to be treated well. They divorced my father when I was 6. He drinks and I hardly see him in an adequate state. My brother is 24 years old and does not even have a secondary education. At about my age, she started using drugs and dropped out of school. I am constantly worried about him. Now he is in a psychiatric hospital. At school, the math teacher and the head teacher constantly yell at me because I have problems with algebra. And my mother also yells at me because of her studies and says that I am stupid. Although in other subjects everything is fine with me. Lately friends have turned their backs on me.

The youngest son constantly reproaches that we do little for him. The feeling of guilt before everyone torments and does not want to live. There was also a relationship on the side, everything was opened, it was a difficult year, my husband pressured him morally and even beat him, but his constant talk about it was even worse. He says that he forgave but distrust constant SMS and calls like where are you. Dad died, and this is probably the biggest blow. And he also says that I am to blame, that God sees everything and takes and punishes, maybe the truth. It's hard to live with it. It seems that everyone needs it and everyone says that they love, but inside is empty. And the feeling of guilt does not allow to live. Guilt before everyone. Even being ashamed to die in front of my family will say that I let them down. Why do they take people who want to live, and those who do not want to live like me. I want to see my dad.",
1,"As long as I can remember, I have never been happy. And there were no prerequisites for this. At the age of 16, for some reason I began to be afraid of the increase in age, I met every birthday as a punishment. I distinctly remember how, at the age of 23, I locked myself in the bathroom and sobbed from the fact that I understood that life was going somewhere wrong and not the way I want it. This site helped me to cope with this problem. And now I am writing here again for help. Until the age of 25, I had no relationships with guys at all, for some reason few people liked me, and those who showed sympathy for me did not like me. And a year and a half ago I met him, at first we communicated as friends, then this communication developed into a relationship. It seemed to me that we love each other, everything was like a fairy tale, until I accidentally found out that he was also dating his ex-girlfriend in parallel with me. The most painful thing is to understand that on his part everything was a lie, and I love him so much even now, no matter what. Now I have no friends (as it turned out, all my friends were his friends and acquaintances who left with him), my parents are far away, for several months I have not been able to find a job, I am ashamed to ask my parents for help, and the money they give barely enough for food and pay rent for a room for a month. I am 26 and now it seems that nothing good will happen in life, I feel like a failure, because I have nothing. I fall asleep every night and I don't want to wake up, I ask God to take me. The only thing that keeps me in this world is the thought of my parents, they will not survive if something happens to me.",

Recently I asked the one whom I considered my friend to buy me medicine if on the way she dropped into the store, she came with a full package of food, but she completely forgot about my medicines ... and this happens often, and not only with her.

Then, when we walked home from school, talked, when we were alone, I confessed that I liked her. She smiled sweetly and averted her eyes - she was shy, reciprocated, we hugged and walked by the hand, and then for the first time I felt what happiness is. Then why am I writing to this suicide site, you ask? Her father found out that she ""got a boy"", met me at school, told me not to approach her anymore, since I was not worthy of her, and she only needed to think about studying (I am from a dysfunctional family + I have even I have no friends + I study at 4, sometimes 3, but she only at 5). I told him that we only communicate platonically, that he may be overly worried, but I don’t understand why, without even giving me a chance, answered: “She has nothing to communicate with people like you.

1,"I'm only 16, but I already feel that I'm tired of this life, how tired of everything, sometimes I wonder why I was born, and in general this kind. I will tell in a small text my whole story, starting from birth. My mother became pregnant with me at the age of 18 , but she did not want me, there were always attempts to kill her daughter in the womb. So my grandparents told me. She left me, and my grandparents adopted me. Time passed, a girl born by a miracle grew up, why a miracle? Yes, because I have never tasted a drop of breast milk, my mother threw it out like a kitten. Since my biological mother was tormented by a hunger strike in the maternity hospital, a huge hernia grew on my navel, as the doctors said, I would not undergo the operation. God was destined for me to survive, my grandfather took care of me, like a mother does not care for her child. Over time, the hernia went away, but I was constantly sick, there was no immunity. I called my grandparents mom and dad, my biological mother started a new family , gave birth to a son, a beloved desired son, and seems to have forgotten about her daughter. I grew up, always thought, pondered why she left me, but there was also a time when her new hubby tried to molest me, freak, I still hate him, when I told her, she always didn’t believe, well, her I adored my grandfather, he was the dearest person to me, but fate is not fair, he was sick, he did not have kidneys, so every 3 days he went to hemodialysis, how he suffered. There was always a struggle for life. But absolutely he recently died in my arms, for me it was a shock, why is it so difficult, difficult. Once he saved me, holding me in his arms at night, and his end came to my hands. Last time I constantly dreamed, 16 times dreamed in 2 months. I always think about him, because I still can't believe it. Now I have such a period where my soul is torn, I don’t understand anything what to do. Another problem that spreads rot me from inside is that, I fell in love with the ""guy"", it turned out that this is a woman who every day forbids communicating with peers, I don't want to be a lesbian, but I don't want to let her go, why is it so difficult to live.",

Although the current grades are normal, but for a quarter in mathematics I always get a C, I even go to additional classes, but I just can't understand. The top three in chemistry came out, but I lied about it. They punish me because of bad grades, so I'm afraid to talk about them. I lied about the top three in chemistry, my parents found out, took everything away. I didn't want to talk, I was ashamed anyway, I don't want to upset my parents. But they do not believe me that I am trying, they think that I am not doing anything. And it's a shame that I try with lessons, I teach everything, but I can't do anything. I am the owner. With my character, I feel that life will be hard for me. Since I already feel this way NOW. I feel pathetic. I hate to be myself. I'm a terrible person. I feel terrible. I want to die. I have no interest in her at all. I feel bad.",
1,". I am in 10th grade, excellent student. I go in for sports, in which I am very successful, although I have been doing it for six months. My parents are divorced, I live with my mother, and my older brother is studying in another country. I also work as a waitress at banquets and sometimes sell ice cream. It turns out that I have no time at all. In the morning I leave for school, come to 2, eat, and at 3 I have to get ready for training in order to be in time for 4. I do not come from training earlier than 8. I am very tired, as I try to give my best to improve results. The coach praises me and predicts a place in the national team. Competitions are coming soon, because training is 5 days a week, and on Saturday after school I go to work as a waitress, home only after 12, not earlier, on Sunday morning I get up in the morning and go to work again, it's good at least on Sunday I only go to the funeral service, and not for banquets, I would generally come home after 12. I had a vacation at school from December 30 to January 9. From January 2 to January 22, I rested only on the 5th. I was extremely tired and didn't go to school on Monday. It was 2 days off in 20 days, but in the evening I went to workout anyway. The problem is that my mother does not understand that I am very tired. I used to complain to her, but now I stopped. There is always one answer * quit training, why do you need it, in the 11th grade exams, do you need this sport now? *. Every day she scolds me, there is always a reason. I didn't get out, then I came late, but that's okay, it's my own fault. But I really have neither the strength nor the time to clean up. But she also scolds me for her brother's shoals, he does not know how to save money, walks, fills a tattoo, spends a lot of money in accordance, but they always scold me. When she talks to her brother, she asks in a calm voice simply why he spends so much, but not more! And I listen to everything. I'm tired. It's like I'm just an outcast in our family. Dad helps us with money whenever possible, but I always have to go to him (we live in the same city). As soon as I come to him, he says all sorts of garbage about mom, and when I come home, mom starts asking questions. He lives with his grandmother, and she also has his brother and his family. Mom starts asking all the gossip, everything. And I hate gossip. I'm not interested in this, because I don't know anything like that. After constant questioning, I already started to freak out. I just get angry as soon as they start talking like that. I'm crazy, but in the end they still scold me, they say you can't tell chtoli normally. I say, if they want to know, then why don't they communicate themselves. I hate it. I'm like a messenger pigeon for them.",

1,"! My life is the same as everyone else's probably ... But with special visits ... Almost always ending some sorrowful stage in my life, I am drawn to suicide ... And moreover, I did this more than once ... But I did not die. .. The last time, and it was not so long ago, I wanted to commit suicide, but for some reason I got overwhelmed and I gathered my strength ... But now I'm afraid that this suicidal state can return if I drink or smoke drugs .. And I also have a terrible fear of a good life ... I'm afraid that it will be interrupted when I get my life right ... It's just that this fear appeared when my husband died when I was 19 years old and I remained pregnant ... I was born a wonderful son ... But sometimes I forget that I can leave him without a mother ... And I am ashamed ... Lately, I have only been engaged in self-destruction ... For the last 8 months I began to use even drugs (not to inject) but just smoking (although I used to be an opponent) I did not even smoke cigarettes before ... But gradually I understand that I am wandering into a hole ... Now I realized a lot and I realized that there is practically no one in my life ... Some I deservedly drove away and some left on their own ... Sometimes I am happy with my loneliness because I am tired of helping to everyone who was around, to exclude everyone ... What led me to debts and loans and I had to sell the apartment and I wanted to buy less ... But at that time I already smoked drugs and I wanted to rest there were depression due to swearing with the guy that I led that I again tried to commit suicide ... And it is hard and painful for me that I caused so much pain to my neighbors ... after all, I really don't know who needs me ... And even my mother needs me or not ... She often reproaches me for my actions and kindness to other people that I drove myself into a hole ... And I often realize that this is self-pity (like I'm so unhappy and I don't move on myself) ... but the fact is that I asked my ex to help a guy with a business but he disappeared and I'm afraid to go to his family where mother and father are because they don't believe me that he owes me money ... And I don't even know where to start and how to live ... I sometimes justify those who owe me money, like they saw my condition, but on the other hand I understand that they they were not my friends, it was profitable for me when I had an apartment where you could rest and then money from the apartment ... And because of this it is hard for me ... It hurts ... I want to start living anew and not think, but self-destruction, but I am not I know how ... I saw so much and nothing pleases me anymore .. I communicated with different people from different strata and societies and different religions ... I myself was an adherent of Islam (I know that I sin cruelly) and moreover of the Sunni sense ... Although I treat everyone well, regardless of nation and religion ... I spent my whole life communicating with the criminal world, although I myself worked in a regular job ... And all my friends somehow improve their lives, but on the contrary, I am falling into a hole ... I am not interested in anything and it worries me ... I do not see any sense ...",

If earlier I tried to be a chaste girl, then after all my ""experiments"" I inside consider myself a ""girl of indecent behavior"". I ""woke up"" after a few months and became disgusted with myself. And I closed in myself and from the whole world, since now I do not consider myself worthy of a good man, I have done too much, which I myself cannot forgive.

1,"I'll start from afar. In my life, like any other person, there were many mistakes. My parents divorced when I was 10-11 years old, but my mother still managed to raise me too spoiled. No, I didn't have everything I wanted, and I didn't have a lot of money, but until I came of age, she solved almost all problems. After my father left, I became friends with a slob and started skipping school to go to a computer club. I then very badly spoiled my grades, despite the fact that before that I was a round excellent student in primary school. It was possible to more or less correct the grades only by the end of the 11th grade, I finished it already without triples. Enrolled as a programmer in a good institute on a budget in another city. I found myself far away from my mother, relaxed, barely finished the first year. On the second, there were already so many debts that I was on the verge of deduction. I went to the academy, left it ahead of schedule and again failed my studies ... I was expelled, returned home, I have been unemployed for more than half a year, I regularly quarrel with my mother. Speaking of which, she's a workaholic. It works insanely a lot so that we don't need anything. Our quarrels are mainly due to the fact that she wants me to sharply become the same as her, and I ... I just can't ... She regularly climbs with her instructions on what and how to do, but for me that's all not so easy. In general, my relationship with her is, to put it mildly, tense. With friends, too, it is not very dense, I already had few of them, and now they are increasingly moving away from me. In my personal life, everything is also sparse, there were few girls, the longest relationship lasted six months. Now I am already 21, no job, no diploma, no girlfriend, no friends, not even a normal relationship with my mother. I understand that I need to do something in order for at least something to change, but only now I do not have enough willpower for this ... I constantly listen to music or something else, just not to be alone with myself in silence ... At such moments, I constantly remember all the mistakes that I made in my life, and this does not give me peace. This only makes my mood worse, I feel a lack of energy, there is no desire to do something. But how do you force yourself? Water will not flow under the lying stone, I need to do something, but I just can't really want to do something ... There is some kind of emptiness in my soul, I don't quite understand why I should at least do something. Some kind of disappointment is already coming to all life. Already a couple of times I thought about suicide, but, fortunately, I did not have enough determination. I don’t want to die, but living like that doesn’t bring any pleasure either. Who can help? And then I have some kind of vicious circle. I am sad because I do nothing and I do nothing because I am sad. It is insanely difficult to break it on my own, and waiting for someone from outside to come and help can be too long with my home lifestyle.",

1,"I don't know what my problem is. If you answer people to the question “Why do you want to die?” With the words “Because I’m too lazy to live,” you can forget about a serious attitude. After all, I do not have any serious illnesses, the whole world has not taken up arms against me, and my life is full of opportunities. Sometimes I have fun talking with friends, doing ordinary things, but every day I think what nonsense it is. And no. I don't want to travel like someone all my life, or have a lot of money and have fun all the time, or do something else - no. I would like to be forgotten. Something like losing consciousness, only forever. I would like so much that I am already close to risking and seeing what will happen after death. But it is not very customary to die after several years of life. And of course with me it is likely that something is wrong mentally. All the same, if I die, then I'm unlikely to return alive, so I keep thinking. The trouble is that every day I lean more and more towards death. As said at the beginning, I don't know what my problem is. Where did I not ask how I can deal with this. The answers only pushed me to commit suicide. And most likely, this is the last place to look for an answer, before a psychologist, but I don't really count on it.",

She is looking for a new relationship, and I just watch. On the last evening, when I came to make up, pick up my things and say goodbye, she cried, and I stayed to calm her down. She has friends, she communicates with others, she may already have new relationships. I tried to forget her in every way, tried everything - to no avail. In the life of every person there is one chance: to study, for a good job, for a loved one. I myself have essentially ruined my best relationship, and this makes it even worse. I have no friends and I have no one to talk to. We loved each other. And I am to blame for everything. I can't forgive myself for this, and I also can't stand it anymore. She feels bad because I am tormented, and it turns out that I am tormenting her. This also finishes. In the coming year, I can't change anything fundamentally, I don't want to torture myself or her.

He came from another city to visit friends. On the first day he said that I would be his wife. And so it happened he made me an offer three times and I agreed. He is courageous, he is a real man!

I felt very bad without him, I did everything myself, all the male duties around the house or not, I did everything myself.

Then the kindergarten was decided by myself, I did everything myself. I solved some problems around the house, the household. The husband only helped financially, nothing else. I lasted eight months.

Again, I'm 21 (I have passed the transitional age, I have always been an independent girl and I am not writing from the fact that I was abandoned by another youngster or there is no money to rent an apartment separately from my parents, because they ""got it""). In my life, everything began like everyone else: school (I studied very well, even excellent), relationships with the guys (thanks to my mother, I came across good boys), after school I entered the university, then it all started ... First year I got a job in one government organization. Everyone around can not get enough of (parents, teachers, relatives and friends): without education and everything worked out. I met a man much older, he was a confident, purposeful, positive, as it seemed to me, character, and he treated me very tenderly and warmly. The first intimate act (in every sense the first). I made sure the time had come. Everything went on as usual, after a couple of months on the test 2 strips. Abortion. Tears, quarrels ... One fine day his wife called. I told him everything and never saw him again. Then life went on calmly. I met a guy a year later (everything happened very quickly on my initiative, I do not regret, but he left me and returned to his ex-girlfriend. moment I already had large problems at work, I was recognized as a suspect in group fraud. It was about a large sum of money, about lawyers, interrogations and confrontations. And a third man appeared in my life, as if by magic, he protected, helped as he could, the main thing BUT he is married and he has two children, I put up with this because the situation with problems at work so demanded just a man's shoulder, which is always there and protects from adversity ... But then I again stepped on the same rake: an abortion ... I killed two children whom I loved with little dots in the photo, medical abortion, this is normal, all the doctors kept saying, plus you have problems with the law, my man was treating my nerves, we will give birth to a bunch of kids ... I hate myself for that .. Today, during interrogation, I was told that I owe a huge pile of money to the state, last night he called me and said that his wife was pregnant with the third and the child was dying ... 2 shocking news in 24 hours ... he did everything to I killed our child and now his child (oh to toror, as he says, did not know) may have died ... if he paid more attention to her and I was not in his life, it might not have happened ... I don't even understand what is happening around, I live these hours like in a dream ... it's easier not to live at all than to live with two murders, for which God will punish and go to jail because of the oversight of the leader ... sorry, I gathered everything in a heap, but it hurts, hurts all my life from adulthood. .. I don’t want it anymore ...",
1,"! Now I am already 47 years old. Looking back, I understand that all my years I lived thoughtlessly, just going with the flow. The biggest joy is my boys, they are already 14 years old. A very difficult relationship with her husband. I understand that nothing good will happen to him, but I cannot divorce. I don't work, he supports us. I feel a strong negative on his part, and I feel the same for him. There are a lot of grudges against each other. Something cannot be solved jointly. It has already come down to the parents whose good and whose bad. Everything in front of the children. My tears are replaced by hysteria, outbursts of aggression. Those close to me do not support me. Children are also more often on the side of their father. The feeling of loneliness and uselessness does not leave. After another quarrel, I began to think more and more about the worst. While the thought of children stops, but it's still scary that in a state of passion I will do something irreparable",

My parents are very strict and have been angry with me for a long time. They do not understand what it is to study in honey, how difficult it is. My father did not believe in me, he said that I would become a janitor, that I would be nobody, that I would not achieve anything in this life. As a result, I returned from the academician, closed 1 course, switched to 2. During this time, I met a girl with whom I have been together for a whole year, I love her very much, she is happiness in my life! But I again picked up debts, was very lazy, I could not close the anatomy, the dean's office said that they were going to expel me. They don't give me time to close my anatomy debts yet, and now I'm afraid that if I am expelled, I will lose everything in this life, and I know this because: firstly, my parents said that they pay for me and if they expel me , then I may not return home to my hometown, that I have no place there and none of them will need me, that I will disgrace them and myself ... Secondly, I was going to propose to her for a year of our relationship with the girl, because I love her very much and she is me, and I feel that she is the one! But we once talked about what would happen if I was expelled. And she said that if I could not close everything and I would be expelled and I went to the army, then she would not wait for me, and that we would part once and for all, since before me she had a boyfriend who went to the army, and that it is very difficult and she will no longer wait for anyone from the army ... So, the best friends, and there are two of them, are studying in other cities, and if I cannot return to my city, then I will lose them and I will never see them again and I will not hear ... The girl said that he went to the dean, talked, and that they gave me more time to take it, but I was in vain lying. I could not go to the dean's office, because I am afraid to appear there and hear the very words: ""We are expelling you."" Understand me, those who will read this to the end, that if I am expelled, then 1) I will lose my family and relatives, I will become an outcast among them who could not achieve anything, who, like a parasite, lived at the expense of his parents and did not justify his hopes. 2) I will lose my friends and acquaintances ... 3) I will lose my love, the love of my life, with which I was going to create my own family ...

A hungry and difficult childhood when you go to school with torn shoes, the absence of a mother who died on the operating table when we were still going to kindergarten, a father who is always drinking and not working, who is from home everything drags everything that can be exchanged for a bottle of little white and being drunk ready to kick out into the street at any convenient reason - these are the first associations from childhood! They grew up and fled, but I still live with my father, scattering debts - no arguments can affect the mind, degraded by alcohol, I hate his drunk, but I know his loving and caring sober (alas, there are fewer such days) I was pretty smart and was at school and in life and always had goals, but my father never missed the opportunity to screw me up, and when you use the opportunities that are, and these are very limited opportunities, then one way or another it all boiled down to the fact that he took away the good that I was trying to make to get complete independence! I entered the leading universities of our country on the budget, but simply did not study due to lack of money for travel, I worked and tried to save money, but then one second and third and I again and again remained at zero, on the personal front, shyness, kindness and poverty is not honored, I can count on one hand in my entire life, but I always turned out to be a loyal and now I was betrayed again ... The pain does not subside, I can no longer and do not want to endure such blows of fate! I know I am appreciated and respected by a considerable number of people with whom I work and communicate, but it does not fill me, I so want my children who have come up with names for a long time so I want my beloved to wait for me at home how many times have I presented these rainbow pictures, I know that I could be a good dad and husband! I'm 30 years old, but for the sake of this dream I kept myself in shape, ran regularly so as not to sag, I quit smoking I can cook almost any dish and learned a lot over the years, but for myself, one and ungrateful drunk father, I try more I don't want to do anything the last betrayal from the girl I loved more than life broke me in half, this is stronger than me, now I just want to see my Mom again and say how much I missed her all these years!",

1,I want to tell you one of the stories that have been spread.,
1,"I want to share my story. At the age of 26, I lost the meaning of life, as if life had stopped and there was no future. I was born and raised in a small village. After leaving school, she moved to the city to enter the university. Life was in full swing, new acquaintances, friends, new life. I was happy every day. I met a loved one. The acquaintance was so unexpected that I thought it was fate that brought us together, but fate had its own plans for this meeting. For me, he was the whole meaning of my life. I didn't even notice how everything and everything faded into the background. I looked at my beloved and saw in him my life, my future. I met his family (brother, dad, grandmother, his friends) with everyone except his mom. Why?! I ask myself questions ?! And now only after 6 years I understand why. For some reason, my mother didn't like me in absentia. She told my beloved that I'm not a couple, I cook badly, I iron badly, everything is bad! For this reason, quarrels and swearing began. And so it was for 4 years. Our relationship is over. He just left, said he couldn't do this anymore. During the time we were together, I moved away from friends from acquaintances, after he left I was left with everything alone. You see, alone in a strange city. My life just stopped. I sobbed into my pillow for weeks, days at night. More than 2 years have passed, but the pain does not go away for a second. A year has passed since the breakup, I started going to a psychologist in order to gradually return to life. On the advice of a psychologist, I began to look for a new relationship, but alas, whoever I started a relationship with, it all ended in failure. One turned out to be married, the second a gambling addict, the third was addicted to alcohol. I already began to realize that something was wrong with me. On the advice of a work colleague, I went to a fortune-teller ... And now for almost 1.5 years I have been living with the thought that I was wearing corruption and a crown of celibacy. Why continue to live if life is no longer happy.",

I have a weak character and do not have those masculine qualities that parents usually instill, on the contrary, they raised me as a ""good quiet boy"". It is precisely that illiquid category that all girls (even mythical Orthodox Christians, whom no one has ever seen in their lives) walk a dozen kilometers. I do not know what to do with myself, the character has already been formed, I can no longer be someone else. Years of trying dating sites have come to nothing, the girls seem to feel that I'm weird.

I write and cry ... now it's even worse ... she also swears at me ... there are also problems at school, all about me they call me ... and much more .. all the same, of course my mother dresses me constantly buys expensive things, gives money, and much more ... but it’s very painful that you have your own mother .. also I have a sister .. with she was all the same .. my sister rarely wanted to kill herself ... once I saw her with a knife ... I really want to die, I think to kill myself ...

I can't communicate with her anymore. No strength to watch. I try very hard, very hard, but I can't. I do not understand why. I have already reached extremes, which until recently was not capable of. I still don't see any progress. Sometimes it seems to me that I wake up with the thought that it would be nice to accidentally die like this today. Well, what if you are lucky to die quickly and not as scary as it often happens? Or I fall asleep with the thought that I am no longer afraid to die in my sleep and never wake up. Why live with constant self-loathing? I'm not happy with myself. Everyone in themselves. Starting with appearance, ending with a moronic character. I tried to change, it's useless, I hate myself any. And then there's this friend with her fantastic success. Apparently, I can only be friends with men with whom I have no competition. But few people want to communicate with me. And those who want to are already completely degraded personalities. Apparently I deserve all the shit that happens to me. It's time to put an end to it. I do not know how to commit suicide so as not to suffer much and not cause inconvenience to those who find me later. Mom, so as not to have to clean there and all that. And it also pisses me off that my body will be autopsied ... I don't want anyone to see it. I'm shitty. I'm not crying. Just a disgusting sensation in the throat and in the brain.

I could not sleep, half the night in my head thoughts were spinning how best to do everything so that no one interferes with me. My best friend committed suicide a year ago. It was a shock. And now I catch myself not thinking that at some point I even envy her. Now she doesn't need to tear herself apart in order to put her brains in order and just live, stretch out at least one more fucking day of this fucking life.

1,"Год назад уволили с работы. Директор допек до белого коления. Расстались очень плохо, уходить не хотел работал на фирме дольше его и сделал для фирмы в 5 раз больше него. Все это вызывало ненависть с его стороны, к тому же владелец фирмы меня ценил, вот я и работал 10 лет боясь совершить ошибку, зная, что исполнительный меня ""закопает"". При увольнени он сказал - ""я тебе в этой стране нигде не дам устроиться,запомни это"".Остался кредит, крыша ехала. Еле еле нашел работу. Мои опасения подтвердились - как только получаю первую зар. плату - он пробивает по номеру  фонда соц. защиты (который не меняется да же при смене фамилии) где работаю и звонит руководству и говорит следующее - ""я хочу вас предостеречь на будущее"" и поливает грязью. После этого меня мягко и культурно просят уволиться и назначают собеседование куда из 15 человек быстро находят нового. В другую страну не вариант, мама старенькая здесь, да и куда сголой задницей переться сегодня и в моем состоянии?!. Год сплю на таблетках. ВОлосы стали седыми наполовину. Постоянно присутствует страх наказания. Жизнь превратилась в ад. На улице опускаю голову, боюсь людям смотреть в глаза. Работу и так оооочень сложно найти, а как дальше жить и работать - да же если устроюсь в голове ежесекундно будут крутиться мысли о том, что может быть в настоящий момент новый директор слушает рассказы прежнего. От этого работоспособность и концентрация снижается в 5 раз. Глубокая депрессия.Ничего не соображаешь от постоянного стресса. СЕмьи нет, девушка оказалась обманщицей, привыкла к обеспеченности. Свой бизнес не вариант, на еде экономлю, а не то что бизнес открыть в кризис, когда кругом все ""закрываются"". Здоровье за год сильно ухудшилось, ничего не хочу. Чувство стыда, что не смог удержаться и что уволили как собаку, чувство позора, что вел себя как ничтожество извиняясь перед ним и прося не увольнять. Кажется что здесь такого!? Просто смени работу. Ан нет - вот как в жизни бывает. Выделяют несколько причин суицида - основные 1. страх наказания 2. страх преследования 3. стыд 4 позор 5 материальные проблемы 6 попадание в безвыходные ситуации 7. безответная любвоь и др. У меня полный букет. Суицидальные сильные порывы я прошел. Дальше весь выжжен, нет психической энергии. Боюсь увидеть кого то со старой работы, он что бы себя обелить и возвысить- год поливает меня грязью, коллектив вторит ему, он же директор, хотя между собой переговариваются что сами в шоке. Как чмо под старости лет матери приподнес подарок. ВРемя идет ничего не меняется, время не лечит когда знаешь что за тобой следят и будут ставить палки в колеса. Чувство стыда и позора не покидает. На ошибках мы учимся, правда моя ошибка просто поломала меня напополам и как дальше жить вообще не вижу. Как сказал один зек на ютубе - поверьте любого человека можно довести до того что он убьет, а потом будет сожалеть об этом всю жзнь и не понимать как он это сделал, любого можно довести до самоубийства например унижениями на работе (как это было во Франции - 36 человек одной фирмы). Более того, да же если устроюсь на работу, гипотетически, работник я стал никакой, так как моральная развалина, какой смысл пахать, работать, рано или поздно сдохнешь. Хотя на собеседованиях я так уверенно всех обманывал своей успешностью и толковостью (научился скрывать свое состояние на короткий период времени и становиться тем кем был раньше), что из 5-ти работодателей 4 предложило работу. Правда 3 из них шаражкины конторы. Вот и сходил  блин поработал. Уверен что никто ничего реально действенного не посоветует, ситуация безвыходная, просто повествую, так как уже год читаю Ваш сайт. В суд не пойдешь, будет всем звонить и говорить что судился с компанией, что будет правдой. Зачем тогда работодателю в кризис брать настолько проблемного если еще 15 кандидатов стоит перед дверью.Это просто жесть, ладно кто то долго не может найти работу, но когда то же находят, а мне что делать, как быть?!

I have been working in an unloved and low-paid job for a year already, work like bring it in. my problem is that I don't see any more sense in my existence. For many years and still I have suffered from acne and other physical health problems. All these problems have developed a strong complex and I cannot live normally. In the family, everyone is busy with their own life and therefore I no longer want to strain my relatives with useless whining. In short, I’m a clumsy, painfully thin, unattractive, pimply and short-sighted guy who’s tired of being sick and downtrodden forever. I'm tired of living like this, I can't look my family members, and people in general, in the eyes, as I'm ashamed of my position and appearance. This despair and depression is caused due to illness and loneliness that has progressed over the years. Of course, I would like to thank my loved ones for all the support and love on their part, but if I stay the same, then my health will deteriorate and I will definitely remain lonely for the rest of my life. I have the strongest fear of the future that awaits me; I am afraid that I will not be able to cope with all the responsibilities and burdens that will be imposed on me. I am afraid of becoming a shame in the family, a loser who could only complain about his problems all his life. I have never had a girlfriend, and for the best all this, I don't want to disgrace her with my appearance and weakness, a guy should not hide and run away from responsibility.

Before that, I had a wife. And the mistress, or rather, I would not want to call her that word. But there is no other way to put it. I really miss her, but I really hurt her, hurt her so much that she hardly wants to see me or communicate with me. I'm even afraid of her.

Soon she will be offended, she will send me, but she will be right. I'm a vile guy. She doesn't deserve that.

My aunt and grandmother took me under the care (my aunt still has a small child), I didn't want to live, but I had to, because my cat would be taken to a shelter by relatives, as they have said many times. The desire to live overpowered the desire to die, at first everything was fine, they coped. I understand that it’s not hard for me alone, my aunt lost her sister, but my grandmother lost her daughter. Initially, I lived close to the school, then I had to move to my aunt's apartment and I already got to school an hour (before that, it took 5 minutes). Health problems began, because of the condition it was not always possible to go to the doctor for an appointment, they rarely called at home, because the doctor was already elderly, they did not call an ambulance because it was too much, they were treated at home, and when it got better, I went appointment. I was often sick and there was less confidence on the part of the teachers, and it was not always possible to bring certificates, problems with my studies began. Everything rolled into a big lump and the commission got involved in this, I categorically did not want to move to another school, because I have a wonderful class and I was very lucky with them. Then the guardianship joined this and began to closely follow me. I got sick with different things, from acute respiratory viral infections, acute respiratory infections, bronchitis to sinusitis, frontal sinusitis, etc. We often swear over problems, everyone persuades my aunt to send me to an orphanage, and my aunt is already starting to discuss this with her grandmother and speaks directly to me about it. I often close myself in the bathroom and hurt myself, it becomes easier, I tell my parents that this is a cat. The guardianship asked to sign me up to a psychologist, they signed me up, I go, my condition has not improved, but it's nice that at least someone understands a little. Everything has come to the point that I can't go to the hospital and no matter how sick I am, I have to go to school, because there are people who are sick and go to work, or people whose life is getting worse. Every day I think about suicide, but I remember about the cat, in fact, nobody needs me, an extra burden for my aunt and grandmother, and they still have a child to raise. I don't want to go to school, I'm afraid of something, although I don't understand why. She was often sick, lazy, did not do homework, but tried to catch up in the following quarters. Now the desire to learn and live is completely absent, but the cat keeps. My parents missed me and began to manipulate me with the help of a cat.

I talked with one girl for a long time, we often talked, communicated, but I don’t know why girls always fall in love with me, I was afraid that she would fall in love and began to cut down on a little communication with her, somewhere I don’t read, somewhere I’m smeared that I didn’t see. So that you have the admonition, the girl was very pretty, but I appreciate something more spiritual in a person, she wrote to me for weeks, I was silent. But somehow I began to understand that this method is the worst and wrote: ""You have been waiting for me so much, what a faithful girl you are, I am pleased with it."" Then everything went slowly, slowly, I prepared myself for her, in order to share time with her, to spend it together and so that we would be all right. It went slowly, but it went on, she always asked me the question: “we might have something farther?"" I answered her that everything will come with time. It seems that you will ask a question so why I was so cold from her, and I am not even able to answer why even now, the fear that someone will suffer for me, probably something like this. Irochka is finishing this semester at school, and she was in the 11th grade, everything improved, all the grades seemed to be going as it should. She finished her studies and went to sit with her friends, but many people in my city know me, they called me, wrote, ""Like, will you come? "" And I was with my friends, and said: ""What is busy, how I will come?"" It was Ira who wanted to see me, but alas, I was a fool and did not come. After these gatherings, she celebrated the New Year in the city and left for her homeland, in Belarus to my grandmother. We saw her that year, I was in a hurry to study and saw her and greeted and ran, this was our last meeting with our eyes ... She congratulated me on the New Year, and I congratulated her .. These were the last messages from to her and from me to her, she read it ... Ira went for a drive with a friend in a car, the driver is a young guy just like me, lost control of the ice or easier snow, and hit a tree. The blow fell on Ira's side ... Irishka received head injuries, and fell into a coma ... You know, I did not know all this ... I found out all this on the day she did not come to her senses ... All these days I wrote to her: ""Ira, answer , Ira, how are you? "" I didn’t understand absolutely nothing, it’s hard for me, I know that adults will read it, I want to apologize for literate mistakes and everything else, do not blame me, even though it hurts me a lot, I lost the person to whom I wanted to say: ""We will be together"" I wanted to see her, I wanted to see her smile ... But I didn’t know, there’s nothing about anyone ... All these days I didn’t think about such a difficult New Year, I immediately told everyone that the year had started badly ... I live in Moscow, or rather in the Moscow Region ... The funeral tomorrow ... I won't see her and I won't even say goodbye to her ... I blame myself for this behavior ... I feel very bad if you have any advice, I will be glad listen to everyone ...

1,". What to do when you wanna die? Mom, my ""smart"" dad is no better. They treat me like a freak, they consider me a brainless, seizure fool. I don’t know how to speak. I'm tired of it. There are no friends in the class. I study somehow. She studied, or rather. Now ""4"" is possible in Russian and English. And before that, one 3 in Russian in terms of and in the annual. I didn’t dare to think about 4… And then… It feels like I was locked in a glass square, in which there is very little oxygen. Very little. They began to visit thoughts about creating cuts on the body, even about the tool with which they will be made. It feels like I have reached this brink, the desire to take and ""die"". Preferably from a car or something else. Yes, at 14 it's crazy, I understand it, but ... A lump rolls up to my throat, tears accumulate in my eyes. And so it is always .. While everyone is complaining, I clench my hands into fists, swallow the lump and go forward. Even the translation did not become a joy, otherwise all this ...",

During this time, I raised my daughter without a husband until the age of 20, graduated from the institute with an ore child, went to work and support the whole family. It was very hard to work and keep the whole household on myself. 10 years ago it got worse - my mother floods our house with feces, I invested so much in the house, bought beautiful things with such love and slowly turned the house into a cozy place.

And then the relationship soured for several reasons, and we did not communicate for a long time. Then I first wrote to him, apologized, he forgave. Now we occasionally communicate, he says, he is interested in me. And ... I would like to actually meet him so that we get married ... These are stupid dreams, I guess. But I know it won't. Because at the time when we did not communicate with him, I had a boyfriend with whom I had sex. And a pen pal, probably, would be unpleasant to know, and in general, he would be against me like that. I am very ashamed and unpleasant to be myself. I'm disgusted. How could I sink like this?",

1,". I'll start with my childhood. I've been a Dumbass since childhood. Even when I was in kindergarten. They say: ""Close your mouth"", and I opened my mouth, stuck out my tongue, they say: ""Don't bite your nails,"" and that's all I did. Not because I was stubborn, no. I was weird. Both externally and outlook. I love animals, as a child I kissed all the street dogs, went with a friend and collected donations for food for homeless animals. I'm ugly . I am blonde, expressionless eyes, a high forehead, a very long face. A little bit plump, but not very complex, as I lost weight, sitting on hunger ... In all camps, even where when I was treated well, someone called me scary ... Later I got used to ... I stupid. Dumb in algebra (grade 7), geometry. I missed a lot, now I don't understand. I don't remember anything the first time. Just look at my spelling and you will understand ... But that's not the problem. At the age of 11-12, I was absolutely blunt, shallow and vulnerable. A great combination. And so I went to the camp! Where I was registered as a loser from the very first day. I'm a crybaby. I went to this camp only because I was promised a dog for it. I was not independent at all .... It was terrible, every day I whined and asked to go home to my mother, threw my things, told my mother about the ""offenders"". But I really was wrong .... Yes, many called names and spread rot simply because of their appearance. But besides, then I painted a lot and brightly because of complexes. There was a person who protected me. I do not remember everything in great detail, almost two years have passed ... It was terrible ... I feel ashamed of it ... Recently, walking down the street, I heard two girls, apparently from this camp, talking about me ... How they laughed ... I don't blame them, I'm ashamed of myself ... I remember the whole past every day, dig, look for, look for a solution and drive myself into depression ... Now I have friends ... The feelings I know most are shame and guilt. I don’t love myself. I do not like my actions and decisions. I'm a shame. Really a shame. More than half a year ago, I quarreled with a friend, she still has not forgiven me, through my fault (accident). And many more mistakes of the past. I don't know how to live on. I'm afraid they will recognize me. I am not a reserved and modest person ..... I think that everyone will be better off without me, such a shame. Every day I think about those days, sometimes it becomes terribly bad (for no reason, no reason), anxious at heart. .... I can't do this anymore, stay awake at night and so on. And also to live with this and not only shame .............. Sorry for my nagging, in my life it is difficult for me to tell someone this .........",

But still between me and the society (class) like a wall I am like in some kind of cocoon. This cocoon does not allow me to understand others, and it does not allow them to understand me. Mom does not love me. Dad kicked out for a long time and he does not care about me. He has another daughter. Mom yells at me constantly , accuses of ingratitude and constantly calls names “stupid, stupid, hooligan, boorish.” But I was finished off by something else. I was obese 1.5 years ago and weighed 53 kg with a height of 155. They teased and I saw myself that it was very fat. For a very long time there were no results. I lost more than a year. I lost weight from 53 to 36 kg. I eat almost nothing. The calorie content of my diet is only 350 calories and sometimes it is lower. There is no strength anyway. And this morning I found a gain! !! Why did I get fat if I didn't lose it? 37 kg. I was in p Anike decided to eat nothing at all. 37 for height 165 (now such growth) is a lot !!!! I `m fat. I don't want to live like this. I have a headache! I'm sick now. The whole body hurts. I cried at school today and I roar at home. Two deuces. And I have no time for them. I think about my fat lads. Well, I have really short and thick legs and they hardly lost any weight !!! I’m an unnecessary schmuck. Why should I live? I do not know how to kill myself 100%, I am afraid of pain, afraid of not beating myself and becoming disabled. Therefore, I have not decided yet. But I think about it all the time. Especially when I'm ugly at myself, I look in the mirror. That was the name of a boy who wanted to communicate with me, wrote constantly, followed me to class, and I asked him to leave me. I didn't want to walk with him either. He is not interesting to me. But hearing about yourself URODIN was painful. Then I thought for the first time. Why live if I'm so ugly? I cried for so long after his words. Mom said like that I myself was to blame. I hurt him. It is not true. I have never been rude to him. And the teachers hate me. I write and tears drip onto the keyboard ...",

1,". I want to tell you my story. Maybe someone will understand me and give me good advice. All my life I experienced a feeling of constraint, a lot of pressure, not confidence. I grew up in a dysfunctional family, with many children. All my life I escaped from reality, I was afraid of everything. School, college, everywhere I was silent, did not study, in order to stand out, I began to smoke, drink. I hardly communicated with girls, shy. In the army, I was also silent and swam in illusion. I always worked with my family and close friends. I was afraid of everything new, I didn’t develop. A couple of years ago I fell in love with a girl, it was difficult to win her. We met a year, I was very jealous of her, I was a yoke, I didn’t develop, I had no opinion. so long ago she left for her mother in another city. threw me and cheated on the ex-man whom she had met for a long time, saying that I knocked her out of everything. 2 months after the betrayal, she marries her husband. We talked with her for another two months, she said that he loves. even saw each other., agreed to be with her, but she deceived me again, saying that I was not a lucky one. I began to dig myself, I am very dependent on people, on, yes it is. I do not know how to communicate with people, I don’t know anything, I don’t develop I live just like a vegetable, I envy many, I myself have not achieved anything in life. It hurts at heart, I was lost in this world, having come up with an illusion from which I suffered greatly. I myself am to blame for everything I have done, realizing that I live in a real harsh world. I do not have enough confidence, shyness, and other complexes. I am very afraid of being left without love in this world. Psychologists, they only got rid of money, but there’s no point. There is no desire to live, I exist.

The eldest son goes to the first grade, the daughter will be 2 years old in February. When the pregnant daughter was walking, they found diabetes. At first there was a gestational one, then a second was placed. First there was the stage of denial. I didn't believe it. Now the stage of depression. Hands dropped. Tired of fighting for my life. I understand intellectually that these are not my thoughts, not my state, but I cannot help myself. I understand where I am going. And I am calm about it. I'm all sick. My hands are shaking, sedatives do not help, and how they will help if there is rubbish in the shower. Yes, I understand, I have to live, but for me this is not life, but existence, my daughter is more permanent, I cannot go to work, there is a lot of debts. I try to tell myself that all this is temporary, that someday my girl will grow up and I will be able to work again. The feeling of uselessness does not leave me. Doom. I went to a psychologist, she told me that everything that we have we deserved ourselves. That I am to blame for everything. Honestly, I completely discouraged any desire to go to psychologists. I so want to hold my grandchildren in my arms, but I'm afraid that I won't be in time. What awaits me with diabetes - severed legs, disability?

Сейчас в 10 классе и,знаете, мне в последнее время все тяжелеее и тяжелее. Наши родственники не имеют таких запретов как в нашей ""семье"". ""Он"" когда домой приезжает, мы все сразу же занимаем позиции. т.е. по TV должны идти либо новости либо карусель. Мать-не ханжа, когда тирана нет в городе я могу сходить с одноклассницей-подружкой прошвырнуться. Он, когда ему вздумается, делает распечатку наших с матерью звонков - детализацию. Раза два сувал мне свои поршивые распечатки, которые я хотела ему в одно место засунуть, чтобы я каждый номер подписала - фам.имя. 2 года мать с отцом не разговаривают (под одной крышей, конечно же, живем, ведь это,простите дерьмо, нас никуда не отпустит, хотя мама и я в частности хотим уехать) после одного случая. 2 года назад мать написала смс женщине, которая жила в соседнем подьезде - нашей землячке. Придурок, как оказалось, даже имеет связи среди полиции, взял номер и узнал имя, фамилию. Из-за этого такое устроил...тем утром я пошла в парикмахерскую (в соседнем доме - 2 шага)вернулась, там это дерьмо с бумажками, уже успел побить мать да еще и на глазах у брата, на тот момент ему было 4 - сидел и смотрел весь этот кошмар,крики. Я сказала ему что-то вроде ""зачем ты ее бьешь?"", а он, что выбросит сейчас меня с балкона. Позже,кстати, нашла на кухне под столом огромный клок волос, понимаю этот момент необязательно писать, но просто вряд ли когда-нибудь забуду это. Не забуду, как потом, когда он уехал, мы приготовили стеклянную бутылку, на случай если еще не угомонился и решит продолжить мягко говоря скандал и убьет мать, я должна буду ударить его по голове и позвонить 02, но этого всего не произошло. Поверьте, он с легкостью мог ее убить, у него даже травмат есть, несколько раз видела в куртке, интересно он его носит...не забуду как в детстве (5-6 лет) с лежала в кровати с мамой, а он бил ее палкой деревянной от моей детской кроватки, я кричала рядом с ней. Он повел меня на кухню за фруктами какими-то. Не забуду, как тогда же я, ложившись спать, слышала как в зале что-то тяжелое падало как шкаф...но я тогда уже знала, что была мама. Она мне после случая с смс рассказала, что давно, когда он пришел домой и позвал ее, а она на тот момент меня убаюкивала, она пошла, подумала голову помочь помыть (воду подливать - в деревяшке жили), но он повел туда где печь стояла, у нас она в отдельном помещении была, и показал на висящую веревку и сказал ""суициднись!"", тут она убежала ко мне...как-то так. так вот, если до класса 9 было более или менее, то сейчас я смотрю на своих сверстников и вижу настоящую молодость, амбиции, немного или много беззаботности, они все естественно общаются м/у собой, в соц.сетях, гуляют до вечера. Я во все это не вписываюсь, особенно в тему каких то любовных отношений, до смерти некомфортно, нет сил идти в эту школу, сил нет учиться, эти дурацкие ненужные мне конференции и олимпиады. А с олимпиад я откосила, знаете почему!?! Из-за отчества, оно с недавних пор не дает мне покоя, непонятное, в двух словах. Поэтому когда была линейка по награждению где собрались 6-11 классы, я была спокойна, что не услышу своего идиотского не как у всех отчества - фи еще норм. На выпускной через год не пойду,потому как люди до утра гуляют а мне если и можно, то только до 8 max  смешно даже. Просто тихо заберу документы... Мама говорит ты на вручение сходи и все, я думаю что за бред, покупать платье на 20 минут. Она не понимает...дура.да! Знаете, не знаю насколько эта тема уместна, но когда у меня пошли те самые дни - в первый раз, она так посмотрела на меня, как-будто я в этом виновата или этого не должно было произойти. Я отчетливо и сейчас помню ее голос, она протянув противно сказала ""выыыросла..."", хотя нормальный возраст-14 лет. Для нее это было как я поняла огромной проблемой, в то время как моя подружка, узнав о моем ""взрослении"" поздравила меня, я недоумевала, думала чего там поздравлять, потом и в фильме каком то увидела и заплакала, как мать с дочкой за это событие рады, я поняла что так и надо- радоваться и поздравлять.как можно ее назвать матерью особенно для дочери? Я намного умнее и мудрее ее. Правда. Можете не верить, но такое иногда ощущение что это мне 35 а ей 16 или даже 5. Я живу среди людей, которые говорят ""аллах"", хотя сама истинная атеистка, наверное моя жизнь на это повлияла. Меня бесит когда мать видя по телевизору женщин в слишком открытых купальниках, цокает и говорит ""какой ууужас"". Мне кажется что такой человек не может судить других успешных образованных счастливых за их свободу, это глупо,по-моему. Была бы моя воля я уехала бы далеко, работала, жила одна, но это невозможно. У нас с девушкой, как с козой, которая одна не может, она ведь домаш.животное, от одних хозяев -родителей переходит к другим- мужу, которого,бывает вообще не знает. Когда моя мать после обручения поговорила с отцом, поняла что он-тиран, запрещающий все. И тогда она сказала маме, моей бабушке и своей сестре что не хочет за него замуж, но они сказали что то типа ""сиди на месте ровно"". Этими словами этим будто приговором они сделали нас несчастными, обрекли на страдания. Он, между прочим, пошел по стопам отца. Тот тоже жену бил, и в один такой случай, тиран ударил своего отца по ногам и испугался, убежал к тете на время. Я вот не пойму - если тебе,скотина, не нравится такой уклаж в ""семье"", так почему тогда сам ""организовал"" все точно также. Ведь можно было стать совершенно другим человеком. И его мать тоже хороша, как я считаю, не сумела воспитать в нем иной характер. Его родственникам от него нужны лишь деньги-всегда. Он отсылает много. Мне и маме на самом деле пофиг. Просто к слову. Я когда была маленькой однажды представила себе картинку большого н",

I have a share of my guilt, and this makes me even worse, I was looking for love and found big hemorrhoids. I cry every day, sometimes I even fight in hysterics. I don’t want to live, I have nowhere to run. I just want to fall asleep and not wake up. I leave the house and can just walk for hours, I don’t understand why and where. I visit the cemetery. , I look closely, how it will be good for me. I want everything there.",

I try to smile back or ignore, but when I come home, my stepfather also starts yelling at me, for the last 3 days, after school, when I come home, I go to bed and tears flow by themselves ... In my life I have only one friend, and even then we do not often communicate with him. My best friend is on the social network, I try not to tell her about problems, I am always cheerful with her too. But ... To be honest, I'm already very tired, one classmate in physical education can calmly call me ""sh ** a"" and ""pr ******* ka"", because I might not catch the ball , he can also hit me calmly. The rest of them most often verbally humiliate me, but in spite of this, I smile, I often feel very offended, but I smile, trying not to cry, at school I often stand aside and listen to music, in addition to this, the elders bully me, mostly from 7th. I'm afraid to tell someone about this. They will start to joke even harder ... I find it quite difficult to endure the fact that everyone at home yells at me. At school they joke, after school I usually walk for about 10 minutes, during this period of time I pour out my soul, quietly in a place where there are no people to myself, tears well up, but I try not to cry. Never before in class can I start crying, I never show my real emotions. I do not know what to do. Tell me, someone please ...",

1," everyone. I'm writing because I really want to die. Someone will say ""Dude, contact a psychologist"" or something like that, but I already had this experience more than once. All these psychologists, for some reason, on the contrary, only interfered. I am only 19 years old, but I already feel dead. Probably because I realized that I have no future. I don’t want anyone to think that I regret myself. No, I’m not. I just don’t understand why I should live if I’m no one needs it at all. And this is not because I am such a sucker who can not do anything, but because it has always been like this. All my life I understand that I am superfluous here. All the people I meet and all the events that happen to me emphasize I’m trying to be normal, I don’t smoke or drink, I try not to swear (although all this is considered cool here) there are even interests. Recently I retired from all social networks. Of course someone says that there you can unwind or find something useful, but not for me. If they noticed me there, they wrote only some nasty thing. And in general I am not one of those people to Some people like the Internet, no matter how strange it sounds. It only makes me bored. I prefer reality. But with reality, things are not better either. For example, they constantly harass me on the streets. Why? Well, someone demands money for booze , someone doesn't like the way I look, someone doesn't like the clothes (although they are quite ordinary) Once a dude tried to beat me up, just because I was wearing dark glasses. Of course, even in spite of a bunch of other negativity , once I was a very ambitious person who really believed in good things and strove to make my dreams come true, but those days have already passed. Now I am engaged in the fact that I sit at home, because I simply have nowhere to go and if I go out somewhere at home, then very quickly I get disappointed, because it becomes very boring. I have neither friends, nor a girlfriend, and if there was someone, then ... I think it’s clear how it all ended. I don’t dream of anything and nothing I believe, I doubt people very much. Of course, you can believe that everything will work out, but this oh, probably stupid, because faith alone is usually not enough. Every day it’s more and more sad to get depressed. I absolutely don’t see any opportunities or prospects. Sometimes I think exclusively about death (there were also attempts) and imagine it .. I just want I don’t know how long I’ll hold out, for some reason it seems to me that I’ll ever commit suicide. If not now, then later.",

It was hard for me in childhood from impotence that I could not change anything. The money is only a pension, there is no housing, there is no money for repairs, I went to school and talked with the best in the class, but behind my back I never told anyone, it's a shame. These problems made my nature strong, then I graduated from a technical school, then I worked, my father died, my brother drowned, and I left for another region for a highly paid position.

Now she returned, again lived on a pittance for a year, worked as a manager, and paid for the apartment for herself and her mother.

However, after 3 years we quarreled over trifles, (he was thumping with friends) I soon went back to where I studied, and he went to the army.

All this is difficult to endure. at my age. how to save yourself from suicide and everything. Lord help me, I would go to church to pray, but I'm not Orthodox.

1,I fight like a fish on the ice,
1,". My name is Ilya and I'm 24 years old. I work as a firefighter in the Emergencies Ministry. I am married, I love my wife. With parents everything is in order, and he himself is alive and well, thank God. Everything seems to be fine. But there is always one but. He crashed an expensive car, naturally not his own. And then it all started, I got huge debts from which I just can't get out, calls put pressure on my brain every day. With his wife because of this constant scandals. I just don't know what to do. And it owes that not quite a huge amount of 1,500,000 rubles, but I really want it to end. Just wake up and enjoy life, and not think about where to get money. I just sometimes think that if I do not become the family will be better without me. But doubts haunt me. I don't need mansions, expensive resort cars. I just want to start living anew and learn to enjoy life again. 2 years I do not sleep normally I do not eat. I just can't stand it anymore",
1,I faced such a problem that I urgently need to tell someone something. And so to tell so that no one knows.,
1," readers! I am writing here because I want at least someone to hear me. It just so happened that I am not used to sharing with my loved ones practically nothing, for everyone I am quite a cheerful person, but inside me there is nothing like that.",
1,"I want to speak at least to someone. I'm 12, I'm in 6th grade. Everything seems to be good, but if I get three or two, for my parents I become the most terrible person in the world. They don't care what they say, they think, that their words ""You have already bored everyone! I wish I had an abortion!"" etc. They will teach me something. Taught. Cutting myself. Cutting myself has become some kind of addiction ... I don't want to live. I am the worst person who does not deserve such a life. I feel very bad. Of course, it's not every day I get 2 or 3 (this is quite rare), but I remember these fights forever, and then I start to remember and cry all night. I often sit at home. I have no friends. I sat for 2 months without leaving the apartment .. Mom said, ""Get out and take a walk! "" to which I always replied that I have no friends. I found them, but my mother is worried and does not allow me to walk with them. I abruptly switch to different topics, but now I feel very bad. We again had a fight with my parents. Because of I have no self-esteem and self-confidence. I’m even afraid to say something to the cashier. I don’t blame my parents for this whole mess, because I get to work. It’s just a shame to hear such words from KIND people. Once again, I’ll I'm tired of living, I want to die, even painfully. Just at least not to hear these words.",
1,"I am a person who has already lived in this world and is tired of life. Every evening, when I go to bed, I ask you not to wake up. It is the second year since I buried my husband. Tears don't dry. If there are angels on earth, then he was one of them. He was everything to me! I really have half of it torn off and it bleeds and hurts. I can’t accept this irreparable loss. Head, heart, soul - everything is torn to pieces. I really miss him and I cannot and do not want to live without him. I do not feel sorry for those who are near. They have their own lives, worries, joys, etc. I don’t want to listen and hear any soul-saving conversations. One thought beats in my head: to die. The question is: how?",
1,"I am 20, I have not been able to live normally for a year. I am on the verge of death, except for her I want nothing. The boiling point has come when I am not able to change everything for the better. I am a 3rd year student, my parents paid, although it was their choice, but I don’t want to force them to live worse because of my paid education ... And it’s very difficult for me to study, a lot of debts have accumulated and ... deductions, my parents will never forgive me and I do not want to know what will happen when they find out, it is easier to die. a classmate helps, and I'm tired of being a burden to her, but I have no friends. For about 5 years already. I am very selective and cannot find a good friend, and I myself am not able to be a friend, I am a bad person. Angry, nervous, squeamish, withdrawn, offended ... I don't even need such a person, and my beloved person, with whom I have cherished hopes for our happy future for 5 years ... Then, at 15 years old, we were children, happy and carefree childishly, and now he has changed and changed plans for life, they no longer coincide with mine ... For a year we live together and all this time we quarreled and were going to part, attempts to return everything were on my part only, and yet the day has come when there are no more chances for a happy future, I am within a hair's breadth of parting ... And I don't want to be his burden, he needs to develop, but I'm in the way .. I'm unhappy, nothing good has happened in life for a long time. I'm tired of everything and I see no reason to fight further.",
1,". I really need to speak out and I would like to receive support, otherwise I will just go crazy. I have such a problem: - a teenager. Not quarrels, no, she herself never even argues, on the contrary she says: ""Yes, mom"", ""Okay"", ""I understand,"" but it seems that she doesn't care, just to tell me to fall behind. This excites me, even, I confess, annoys me. I didn’t succeed in developing her grasp for life, seriousness, she was in melancholy all the time, and it seems that now she’s going to break. Sometimes euphoria finds her, she begins to do something useful, helps around the house herself, prepares in addition to exams, but she lasts for a maximum of 30 minutes - an hour, then the same apathy for everything. She is 16 years old, she has no girlfriends or friends, she cannot maintain relationships with people (she constantly communicates only with me and her father, no one even calls her on the phone). Every day she writes me such SMS: ""I'm lonely"", ""Do you really love me?"", Or in the middle of the night ""I want to commit suicide"", I go to her room, sleepy, she cries. I am the kind of person that I despise weak people like her. She was always a leader, easily got along with people, made friends. Therefore, I have two higher educations, and everything in my life is wonderful. On her nose she has the Unified State Exam and entering the university, looking into her diary, not a week goes by when it is not written to her in red in the margins: ""Doesn't listen"", ""Is in the clouds"", ""Was distracted / talked in class"". I just want to knock her down. I start talking to her, she immediately bursts into tears, says that she is to blame and she herself understands that she was framed by her classmates, etc., does not bear any responsibility for herself, blames everyone around. I explain that she must be responsible for herself. Agrees again. It seems to be sincere. But next week the picture is the same. And how does she think to study at the university? How does she want to dispel her loneliness? With such an attitude to people and to study, she will have no future: she will be kicked out from the first stage. I don't want to drag her all my life, I wish her well, prosperity, create a family, find herself in life, so that she is a full-fledged person. I already beat her, and deprived everything, access to a computer, music, all her favorite entertainments, even took away a notebook for poetry. Her depression only intensifies (she loses interest in everything in general), and I really am afraid to leave the house, suddenly do something to myself. I begin to reproach myself that I will treat her too cruelly, because when I calm down and look at her, she is not a bad girl, dear. I forgot to tell. She is an adopted daughter, we took her from the boarding school with her husband when she began to be in her teens, that is, we did not raise her from infancy. I think that may be the problem. From all these nerves and thoughts I began to take alcohol, on the one hand, it calms me down, on the other, I want to strangle my daughter, or lay hands on myself. I am morally exhausted and I do not know what to do, except how to commit suicide I see no way out. I really need support, or advice on how to act in my life situation, how to help my daughter. Thank you for reading the message to the end. I really hope for your help.",
1,"I want to commit suicide .. I can't do this anymore. I entered college, found new acquaintances. For half a year of study, I became very close to the girl, became close friends. For the first time in my life I had such a person. A month ago, she began to notice a strange attraction to her .. Jealousy when she communicates with others, the desire to hug her all the time, to be near. I lose my mind when she hugs me .. Realizing that this is not normal, wild pain, tears appeared, at the sight of her I was shaking all over. I can't understand what's going on .. Is it friendship or something more .. Every day this pain intensifies .. I began to cut myself, everything became disgusting.",
1,"Long ago, I moved from one end of the country to the other. It was insanely difficult, a transitional age, it seemed that there I just started to find myself and move ... To say that my world collapsed is to say nothing. Then I started walking and drinking heavily. It didn’t interfere with my studies, and some wouldn’t call it a spree, student years after all ... In one of these spree I found my wife. I just didn't want to be dishonest with her and we started dating, wanted children and got married. Early. She was not 18, her relatives did not mind, oddly enough. We got married. There was work from the category of ""stable, but not enough"". I loved this job. But my wife did not like it, they could not leave their parents. As a result, our paths diverged, even before the divorce ... We see the child often. The relationship is good. Then there was a girl, I loved her very much, but she left me, just like that, ""everything went away"" in her words. I went on a spree and lost my job because of stupidity. I got a job as a teacher - a youngster stuck, and this little is said. Removed all social networks. Had to leave because of rumors. Now I have been out of work for a very long time, almost a year ... I don't know what to do ... The feeling that I had everything, soon 30, but I feel like an old man. There is a girl, I love her very much, she loves me, respects the parents, the child also mostly only makes me happy. And the fact that there is no place of my own in life is killing me ... I tried a lot of things during this time, to arrange work for myself. But nothing happens, I slowly go crazy :( Living for the sake of loved ones is good, but being a nice kind person who is not adapted to life does not bring joy, to put it mildly. I cannot calmly look in the mirror.",
1,". I will not go into details for a long time. Former husband six months ago, out of revenge, stole and hid my little son (a year and a half). His mother was on his side, since from the very birth she asked me to give the child (she always wanted a second, but cannot give birth). For three months I was looking for my child in another city, filed a lawsuit, the courts dragged on for another six months, the decision was never made. What I have experienced during this time, only God knows. Through guardianship, I achieved the opportunity to see the child once every two weeks (at the same time, it was necessary to travel far and more than one hour). The child's father has an insanely expensive lawyer, I have an ordinary, almost free one, who almost does not help. The court each time tilts on the father's side. After three months my son did not recognize me ... then he gradually began to get used to it. In my father's house, they constantly mock me, they say that soon the child will be sued and all debts and alimony (in total more than 150 thousand) will be blamed on me. I have nothing to pay, since I work as an ordinary cook. But worse is that I see how bad my son is there ... yes, he has a lot of toys, he is fed and bathed. But he was with me from birth, saw my father and grandmother once a month. At the commission, the son was put on deprivation (but the lawyer somehow proved that I was not looking for a child, I have no idea how ...). On my last visit, my son had a huge sutured wound on his forehead. I wrote a hundred times to the guardianship, to the police, the ombudsman for the rights of the child, and I ran around all the authorities. Nobody can do anything. My child is bad, and I can't do anything. When I leave, he yells ""mom"" and these creatures carry him to another room. He is thin, pale, he has bruises under his eyes ... but the guardians don't give a shit, the judge apparently too (made a temporary order for the child to live with his father). Nobody hears me ... I hardly sleep, hardly eat. Friends distract as much as they can, borrow for trips, feed. But my strength is running out, I cried out all my eyes, and so when the child was taken away, I almost lost my mind. I wanted to kill my husband and his mother, but then the son would be sent to an orphanage. sedatives don't take me anymore. I don't want to live. There is a movie like ""I'll be better"" (there is a good trailer), there are the words ""Even a shameful child prostitute gives meaning to life."" And they took my meaning away from me. Every time I go there, I then have a wild hysteria. Burnt out. I do not want anything, I can not stand the sight of other people's children, I just want it to end. Of course, you will write that I am an egoist and what my son needs, but what is the limit of human patience? .. Where is the end of these six months of hallucinations at night, when the whole apartment is full of children's screams? ... where is the end of bullying when your only one is pulled out of your hands? the baby you breastfed, adored, pampered, and never parted with? husband and his mother, not remembering himself. As a result - a statement to the police, registration, a letter to the psychiatric hospital and the judge found me unbalanced and dangerous for my son. Everything was done by that expensive lawyer (and mine works on the principle of little paid - you can not work normally). Mine, as in the film, tells me ""We must live on."" Why should I live on.",

I went to church, studied, suffered every damn day from this love that ate me up. Then I met a guy, started a new romance, but I kept thinking about the old one and the fact that then everything was real, and now it’s a linden. I thought New Guy was so good and understanding, I tried to love him. After a certain amount of time, she overcame herself, was able to remove the remnants of old feelings and devoted herself entirely to these new relationships. 2 years together, we came together, there were many contradictions, but I thought that together we would cope. So, 2.5 years of relationship, he gives out that he likes another, I move to my parents, the relationship is over. It was as if I had returned to the past, I understand that I have come across the wrong person, I understand that the old cannot be returned, that this is a new stage, but I just suffer unbearably almost every second of my existence. I dream just to stop it, because I no longer have the strength. I used to think hurray, I survived, I found true love, I'm happy. And it was all an ILLUSION. Well, how and why to live on?

1,"Здравствуйте! На моем счету 2 попытки самоубийства первая обошлась без больницы,а после второй меня откачали. Спросите зачем я это сделала? Очень много причин. С самого детства я была странным ребенком,никогда не чувствовала себя частью общества,а ощущала себя третьей лишней. Так же у меня есть неадекватный отец алкоголик,который не раз угрожал убить меня и мать. Я терпела это всё детство.. Моя депрессия началась еще с 2015 года,когда меня предала лучшая подруга,единственный человек,который знал обо мне всё. Я безумно тосковала. Далее произошла очень серьезная ссора с отцом и я ушла из дома к бабушке и прожила там 8 месяцев. 4 месяца из них я буквально умирала и чуть не умерла,тогда произошла моя первая попытка. Но я выжила,и я решила уехать из города,пыталась поступить в лицей,но мне не хватило буквально пяти баллов. Я загонялась и мне не хотелось жить. Но вдруг в моей жизни появился человек,который сделал мое лето счастливым. Мой первый парень,первая и безумная любовь. Даже получше,чем в большинстве фильмов. Но все длилось не так долго,он предал меня,изменив с бывшей. Он обещал мне,что не будет не коим образом идти на контакт с ней. Так же помимо нее у него было много подружек. Но я не особо ревновала к ним. Он скрывал от меня,что гуляет и общается с бывшей. А в последний наш вечер,когда он проводил меня до дома. После того как я зашла в подъезд,он встретился около моего подъезда со своей подружкой и обнимался с ней. Я не выдержала и рассталась с ним. На следующий день,как мы расстались мне начали приходить фотографии,как он ходит за руку с бывшей. Я терпела ,плакала. Но вдруг одним темным вечером я увидела их идущих так же за руку,вместе с ними была большая компания. Я не могла это вытерпеть. По своей природе безумно эмоциональный человек,который не может сдерживать свои эмоции. Я сделала ужасную вещь. Разбила ему нос,тем самым унизив его перед всеми и ушла. Ненавидела себя за этот поступок. На следующий день,когда я шла к подруге за мной проследили и он ударил меня. Был синяк. После этого произошла моя вторая попытка,дошло до больницы. За 8 дней меня привели в норму. Моя мама.. Мне так стыдно перед ней,но я не хотела и не хочу жить. Сразу же после больницы меня перевели в другую школу. Было сложно в новом коллективе,но это было ненадолго. Потому что меня буквально через 2 недели я перевелась обратно,ибо он ушел из школы. Я была рада,что хоть коллектив более менее знакомый. Училась,провалы в учебе,меня как будто не было в своем собственном теле. Всё это время убивалась по нему. Через несколько месяцев извинился. Я простила. Но..Я же человек недалекий. Буквально недавно шли с подругой и я увидела его,обозвала его двумя мерзкими словами. Опять мне стало стыдно,я не умею контролировать свои эмоции. В ответ же мне начали приходить сообщения с угрозами. Я извинилась за эти слова,это было глупо после извинений обозвать человека. Но,угрозы только усилились. А буквально сегодня мой отец угрожал нам с мамой пистолетом. Мне трудно и больно жить. Я не понимаю кто я? Зачем я? У меня нигде не выходит,везде всё плохо. Мне не хочется жить. Я совсем одна.. Ну разве только мама,только ради нее пока что и живу. Мысли о самоубийстве не покидают меня. Мне правда очень плохо..Ненавижу жаловаться,ноя просто не знаю что мне делать. Одна в таком большом и жестоком мире. Как справиться с этим со всем? Я прошу хоть каких нибудь советов",

1," dear readers. I am writing in the hope of help. I don’t know whether you will understand me or not, I’ll try to explain as much as I can. Not so long ago there was a psychological trauma. A breakup with a loved one. After that, my worldview changed very much. I started dripping myself, the point is that during these 25 years I was not a realist, but lived with some kind of illusion, drifted with the flow, did not have my own opinion, was not fussy, loser, shy, lazy, coward, worthless vegetable, I am not a person! I realized all this late. I tried to start a new life, but I can't, I have no self-confidence, I am very suspicious, and I don’t understand what is happening in this world, who I am? What to strive for, like a vegetable. I suffer from unrequited love, She left me, and got married to evil because I am not lucky. Every morning I wake up with no desire to live. There is no joy in life. I am to blame for everything. I am not a thing., and I am not worthy to live.",
1,"! I have such a story, dad and mom had a fight and do not talk, I know that dad is cheating on mom, I even know with whom, and mom is waiting for dad when he will ask for forgiveness, and dad is not even going to ask, my dad is sick. recently had an operation, now he is doing everything so that I, too, hate him. I'm already tired of everything, and I want to do something with myself, I hope then they will make peace!",
1,". There is nothing that interests me. I feel everything is unnecessary. As a way to occupy your time with something, and nothing more. I don't understand what I need in life. I used to think I needed love. It turns out that no. I get it, but I want to love myself. I love ... but not passionately, but as a loved one, close. I am not at all attracted to romantic love with this person ... and we have been together for a long time. And the person knows about it, it seems to him the same ... The problem is not that. I was always lonely, and this person (the only one in my life!) Began to listen and hear me! Understand! I can tell you everything and I will be understood. But all the same, everything is not so ... I feel like an attack of death from day to day. It’s like I don’t feel anything, I don’t feel anything. No emotion. And my loved one began to annoy me in many ways ... I felt alive when I fell in love, but I never fell in love mutually. Now I have stopped falling in love, with no one. I'm also a social phobia - I have a panic in public places. I have problems with work and education. I have nowhere to put myself ... as if I'm finished. I sit at home all day, I have nowhere to even go ... and the years go by. Nothing attracts, not interesting ... I don't know where to go ... I'm tired of feeling death during my lifetime. I used to have friends, but I felt bad in their company. I always wanted to be alone. I'm better off alone. But this cannot go on any longer ... the walls of my house will soon be dreaming of me in terrible dreams! And my loved ones will soon get tired of paying for my needs. What should I do, where should I go ... What awaits me? A cleaning lady or a nanny in the garden ... this is my destiny (I do not want to live ... Just do not advise me to convert to religion or find a hobby - it does not help. Please help me ... Maybe I need a new friend with such same problems ... But I cannot make friends with anyone, I have a fear of communicating with new people.",

1,"My life has changed dramatically. Has changed not for the better! Until the age of 30, everything was stable and good: I developed, I was surrounded by many acquaintances, I often traveled, played sports. I lost my father two years ago. Then one of my acquaintances fraudulently appropriated all my savings. Later Mom fell ill. Immediately there was no time for personal life. For a long time I could not come to my senses: I stopped communicating with friends, I could not work, I gave up on sports. For about a year he adapted to a new lifestyle. The trial with the swindler began after that - the process is long, it is still going on. I'm 34 now, I can't start a family, it really annoys me. I can’t start because of material difficulties. I try to recover, but I can't. The thought that I am already 34 eats me, and I need 3-5 years to recover. If I were 25, for example, then I would not be so driven. He began to notice that he became irritable, shook the meaning of life; I look pessimistic to the future, even negatively! I really don't want to live anymore. And it's not emotions that speak. Visited psychologists. They listened to me and said that we need to understand ourselves, everything has its time, and the ball blah blah. In general, I asked questions, I myself answered them. The topic of death does not scare me at all: I thought about the departure of people from life before, I read scientific literature. In general, I have a real dead end. At one point I stopped thinking about leaving, but lately this thought has started to eat me even more from within.",

Recently my mother returned from earning money, but when she saw me she said that I had badly deteriorated during her absence (six months) And my grandmother is very strict, although sometimes she protects me. I can't be with them ... Once, I had a delay and my mother asked if I still had relationships with boys? But since she never shielded my problems with hers and said that I was making it up, I said that I almost slept with a guy. It was just insulting ... strongly ... And the first thing she did was not hug and did not find out the reason for such drastic changes, which is unusual for me. Mom was worried about what others would think.

I'm tired of constantly wishing myself death, tired of constantly crying at night. I want to get away from them .. all .. I would even like to see what happens to them after I leave.

I don’t have enough energy, even to go out and drink somewhere easy, although where to go is someone who needs me ... Right now, I feel very bad at heart and there is no one to tell this to. As it turned out, I am not fit for this life in this world, where you have to be arrogant, stubborn and smart and striving. I'm not like that, and after all, how to live, I don’t know. Probably I'll just die of hunger and achieve nothing else. I have no purpose in life. I understand that this whining will not do anything, will not change anything, everything will become as it is, but I see no other choice. I constantly want to die, I even have something to end this all with, but I am afraid to die very much, but the hunt is inside to die. I do not feel anything as joyful and positive in life as it seems. Inside it has already rotted completely, it remains to die in silence.

1,"Good afternoon ... I came here for help. I'm a little reluctant to write about this, but I really need some kind of support. My parents have been divorced for about four years. My mother found a young man whom I, to put it mildly, hate. I have been jealous since childhood, I admit it and do not deny it, my mother was always jealous of other people's children. But now, in connection with four years of depression and such a situation in the family, I increasingly think about suicide. Because of the nerves and ""holding"" everything in myself, I notice nervous breakdowns, fainting, nervous tics. It turns me inside out when I see my mother with him. The fact is that lately my mother has stopped paying attention to me, and she walks around with him and lisps. It will help him once again, but yells at me and takes all the anger out on me. It hurts to see it every day. But these are still flowers. He (that is, my mother's young man) intervenes in our conversations with my mother. And there was a case when he told me in my face that no one needed me like that, and in general I was all ""not like that.""",

I can’t show my love for my relatives, I just don’t succeed, so my parents think that I’m an ungrateful brute, I always do them just a shame that there’s no return from me, that they raised a bastard and a freak. I've always been a strong person, but now I have thoughts of suicide. Knowing that I can completely calmly do whatever I want with myself, I am afraid that I will still lay hands on myself and make everything worse. What should I do ?",

Was registered with a psychiatrist, went to many psychologists. The depression receded a few years ago, but nevertheless returned, in an even more depressing form. For the last year I have been living in a daze. I have no friends, no job, I don’t study properly, I don’t leave the house anywhere. I don't even want to do some hobby. My only communication is the Internet. Naturally, I don’t complain to my mother. As a teenager, I tried to ask her for support, but it never ended with success. I have always heard only reproaches for my own weakness, that it is shameful to be registered with a psychiatrist. Therefore, I don't even try to talk to her. She doesn't even notice that sometimes I just lie on the bed and cry. I didn't notice when I didn't eat anything until I had a hungry fainting spell. I tried to get a job, and now I want to. I don't really have the strength to crawl out somewhere, but it's better this way than continuing to sit locked up. After the holidays I think to go to a psychologist, although I am very ashamed to complain to him. But it may somehow be possible to remove everything that has accumulated inside. After thirty I don't want to live at all. Despite the fact that I would really like a husband and a family in the future, I understand that I will not have one. Nobody wants a wife with so many cockroaches in her head. The guys who meet me notice the longing in their eyes. Then I completely lost interest in men. I started drinking a lot every week. I want to talk to someone, I want to be important to someone, needed. I no longer want to lie down, cry and try to fall asleep without thoughts, in which I reproach myself for being insignificant.",

1,"Help me please! Advice, a kind word, personal experience ... Every day for me is just torment, endless pain and suffering, I don't want to live, there is no hope for the best. I got sick 8 years ago and today they still can't diagnose me. It all started with fatigue, which gradually increased and knocked me down, in parallel, a strong headache, dizziness, nausea, low-fibril temperature, a veil before my eyes joined in ... ranging from infections (herpes, Epstein Bara), ultrasound of all internal organs, vascular Doppler, ending with an MRI of the head (repeatedly) and the entire spine. At first, the vessels were treated (with vasodilators) - nothing helped, then they suggested arachnoiditis (although there was no such thing on the MRI) - after the treatment it didn't get better, then again examinations, treatment of the vessels ... the result was zero. And I just die every day from this pain, it drained me completely! My head constantly hurts, constantly, the pain does not go away for a minute, I feel sick, objects stagger in front of my eyes, I absolutely cannot concentrate on anything. Life has turned to hell! I constantly think about death, I can't live like that, it's just a painful existence! But I'm a coward, I don't have the courage to do it. At first I felt sorry for the parents, now the child is small ... Why does the child need such a mother ?! Always ill, in no mood, crying. My husband is already tired of this, he cannot understand how bad it is all the time and no medicines help! And I just want to climb the wall from this hopelessness! I do not know how to live with this further and where else to seek help. The doctor I visited not so long ago suggested trying the drug finlepsin. But I no longer believe that something can help me, any medicine only makes me worse, and I feed the child, I'm afraid that it would not affect him in any way. Help, I beg you. Thank you in advance.",

I don't care about everything, I'm used to everything being done for me and I can't imagine life in another way.

Well, this holiday will come, well, it will pass, and I will continue to sit in my computer and nothing will change. Before, the thought of studying somehow occupied me, there was some goal, motivation, but now - nothing. Lump in the throat. I don’t know what to do on these vacations, moreover, I just don’t want them, I just want to die from this realization of the unnecessaryness and innocence of myself. I don’t understand why it’s with me and how it all started, I don’t really remember, but this has been going on for quite a long time. my family is me and my parents, whom I resemble, but by nature they are like that: they have no friends, boring, monotonous, immersed in routine and everyday life, they hardly talk to each other. they gave me such a family model that I don't want my own family. Why do I need a husband? to make me bored with him? so that all I could do was sleep all day, work, watch TV with him and cook food? and it costs life? Is it worth giving birth to another person and giving him exactly the same life? I'm just tired of this depression and I don't know how to be. and I can't find a husband for myself, I really don't know how to talk, I don't know how to interest a person in conversation, because in my family people only talk about business.

1,". I stumbled upon this site by accident. Half an hour ago, I was preparing for suicide <ed. Mod.> And still could not decide on it. I don't like whining, but since everything is anonymous here, I can complain at least once in my life. I work, study, live with my parents and an older brother (I never considered him to be such). I am quite a popular person on the Internet, I earn from advertising in the same way. I have a boyfriend and a best friend. It seems, what am I doing here? The fact is that everyone around me tells me what a worthless nothing I am. My mom doesn't know that I've been dating a guy for a year and a half, just because I didn't say. He is Russian, and she does not tolerate such people. I cannot share my usual joys with her. All my life I was afraid of my parents, so I got used to restrain my emotions in myself. I don't know what the future holds for me, as my parents are against such a relationship. Also, my brother constantly drives me, although he is 25 years old and still sits on the neck of his parents. He beat me several times in a fit of anger, once he even beat me severely. But I did not go to the police and the medical point, my mother asked. My parents have been working in the service industry all their lives and earning a pittance. They are much older than the normal parents of my peers. About two years ago they started to get sick, and I understand what will happen in the next 10 years in my life. I have severe depression about death, very often I can close and cry for no reason. I look every day at how cruel this world is, and there is nothing I can do about it. Parents constantly point out to me mistakes, demand more and more from me, control at home, at work, at school, and I do not feel like a living person. Everyone treats me like a piece of shit, sorry for the expression. I just don't see the point in living. The constant circulation of money, imaginary achievements at work, and everything at the end of the concert leads to nothing. It just hurts me to live",

He loved me with sick love, scoffed, followed me, I spent so much energy with him, so many tears and nerves to remember is scary !!! And then she left, ran away! I was left alone with the loans that he took in my name, climbed into another one, so that there would be something to pay for the current, a complete madhouse! Money problems started at work, they rarely paid, and then I met a man, he promised to help make money, like he made bets, and he knew exactly where and what to bet on! I gave him a very large sum of money from clients! And he disappeared ... It was the end, just the end (now, in addition to loans, I still have to at work, while they do not know about it, but when they find out, they will definitely either jail me or do something else, they do not give me new loans, ask there is no one (only a mother who lives on a modest salary) there is nothing to sell either!

1,"У меня было не лучшее детство, я из небогатой семьи. Мама родила меня рано, в 19. Они с отцом любили друг друга и сейчас вместе, но я перенесла в детстве много травм, очень частые их скандалы, в том числе на почве ревности и алкоголя. Отец бил мать, мать била меня, но я знала, что она меня любит и всегда ее жалела. У меня никогда не было вещей, как у детей из обеспеченных семей. Я старалась не завидовать, смотрела на тех, кому хуже. Мало кто знал, что у нас дома такая жизнь, все думали, что мы примерная семья, но мне жить не хотелось. Я часто просила Бога меня забрать, были неудачные попытки уйти самой, о них до сих пор никто не знает. В 17 родители помогли поступить в универ, и сейчас помогают, чем и как могут, я их очень люблю, потому что несмотря на такое детство я знала, что и они меня любят. В 18 впервые поцеловалась, парень этот был первым, младше меня на пол года. Бросил через месяц, как переспали. Продолжала любить его, 3 года была одна, никого не видела, было плохо. Потом были несерьезные парни, для здоровья. Сразу после универа, с красным дипломом, получилось найти хорошую работу, самой, без помощи/денег/постелей, по сей день там. В 23 встретила мужчину на 13 лет старше, влюбилась очень наивно и очень сильно, через пол года узнала, что не одна у него. Очень болезненно восприняла разрыв, было еще хуже, чем в первый раз.Через год стала встречаться с будущим мужем, полюбила его со временем, сердечно привязалась и считаю родным человеком. Сейчас 27, на последнем месяце, ждем девочку. С мужем были серьезные проблемы, на почве его мужской свободы. Характер требовательный, эгоистичный, как у большинства мужчин. Ему можно все, я это другое. Кое-как притерлись, опять же было трудно, в какой-то период не выдерживала его морального давления, оскорблений, слов о том, как он ошибся во мне, резала вены. Но завершить не смогла. Опять же об этом никто не знает, кроме него. Потом была куча упреков, что ему не нужна такая ответственность за мою смерть и тд. Я его в этом понимаю. К слову, в целом человек я не глупый, заканчиваю второе высшее, неплохо научилась видеть людей, держать язык за зубами, когда нужно проявлять агресстю, защищать себя и близких. Сейчас с мужем очередной виток непониманий, у меня трудности с последним месяцем береиенности, дед в тяжелом состоянии в больнице, 89 лет, присмерти. Муж гуляет с друзьями, глворил, что только с мужиками, но как оказалось, в их компании затесалась неясного происхождения женщина. Он не выключил трубку и я услышала фрагмент их совместного пьяного безудержного веселья в кабаке. Приехала в кабак, закатила скандал на улице. Теперь виновата во всем, слышу очередные оскорбления и что таких ублюдских поступков от меня больше не потерпят. Сижу с животом, 36 неделя, плачу от обиды, несправедливости и жалости к себе. Развод с моей стороны не выход, я воспитана в понятии, что на женщине держится семья. К мужу привязана, никого ближе у меня нет, ему никогда не изменяла. Хотя мысли посещали и кандидаты имеются, но мерзко это для меня и мы венчаные. Перед ребенком стыдно, что не выходит контролировать состояние свое, ребенка жду и люблю. Но жить по прежнему желания нет, нет и стимула. Ребенок, работа, не держит. Сама ничего с собой не совершу, ибо не сама себе жизнь давала, не могу этого сделать. Родители не вынесут, их жаль. Видела смысл в своей семье, но строить ее не выходит, очень трудно и больно. Прошу Бога забрать меня, послать неизлечимую скоротечную болезнь. Думаю, что узнав о такой, не сообщу никому, чтобы не страдали, отдам всю любовь, что есть и уйду в покой. Человеческая жизнь кажется слишком долгой, когда даже при всех попытках построить ее самостоятельно, редко получаешь что-либо, кроме боли. ",

Sometimes it seems to me that I am not the best daughter. I'm afraid to think about the future, what will happen next. I'm all alone, my friends are already in my family, but I can't do anything ... There is no good job, and there is no personal life at all. I have no one to talk to, I don't want to burden people with my problems. Parents are in another city. I don't want to come home, because no one is waiting there. You look at happy families and everything hurts inside. I don’t know how to live further, it’s very hard and scary. I try to be distracted, I go in for sports, but loneliness eats me up .. I want to love and be loved, I want a family and children, but sometimes it seems to me that this will not happen. It becomes scary, you wonder the question is, why then everything at all? I am very tired, tired of lack of money, of hard work and loneliness.",

Neither I nor my wife believed in this. In the end, she also got infected, I killed her. Throughout the year, divorces and bonuses, they tried to live with it. Now she's gone, found another. It's hard, thoughts are all there. Lost my job and my meaning. Okay, I live as best I can. I came to my mother, stayed for three days, she had a stroke, was paralyzed. Now I go to her and help her as much as I can, but my soul is hopeless.",

1,"My name is Albert Rafilevich Khasanov, I don’t want to live in this life from time to time there are plans to open my throat and end my life with nothing. Parents do not help me in this life, no one needs me. Please tell me what to do. I am on a disability group of the brain, and dizziness is constant, headaches are constant",
1,"I want to die. I want to end this life, stop this pain. And it's all about me. I am 24 years old, I am short, very thin in build. I have very poor eyesight, I wear glasses all my life, which is why there are a number of complexes. And I have chronic viral hepatitis C. But all this is not the main reason for my desire to kill myself, but only secondary factors. The main reasons are very low self-esteem, lack of work and money as a result, and I left my beloved woman. It probably started with her. We were together for 5 years, we lived together for a year and from this year, for half a year, she cheated on me with another. I found out about this only a couple of months ago. I packed my things and went to live with my parents in another city. Now our relationship with her is not understand that ... Then everything flares up with a new passion and just about everything will be fine again, then it fades, flooding everything with a huge amount of hatred and sorrow. I seem to be sitting on the ashes of past passion and smearing myself with coals from past love. Yesterday she wrote that I was a rag, although I myself have known this for a long time. I've always been weak and frail. Parents said - study and I studied. I now have two honors diplomas of higher education, but there is no sense in them - people with such poor eyesight and health are not in demand on the labor market. For a month now I have been forging prescriptions, like from a doctor, to buy myself strong tranquilizers. I get drunk on them and sleep all day and all night, just not to wake up in this world, not to remember who I am and what my life is. I don't eat almost anything, I just drink water. I lost a lot of weight. I've already thought a lot about methods of suicide, it's scary of course, but I don't see any other way out. And I would like to say right away that you shouldn't write to me about God, etc. I have addressed him more than once, but he does not hear me. I even thought about adopting another religion, maybe there are answers in it, but it is unlikely to come to that. Probably another atheist will soon appear in the world. I will not go to a psychologist on principle, and there is no money for it either. Of course, I feel sorry for my parents, but I became too much of a burden for them. Of course I would like to live at least a couple more months, but I'm afraid I can't stand it. Every day the moral becomes worse and worse and together with the spirit, I see, the body also dies. I am sure that soon I will simply ""break down"", and in a fit of psychosis, I will carry out my plan. I am a serious person and if you do something, then for sure. I can’t live like this, but I don’t have the strength to change something. I would like to thank the site and its creators, for several years ago an audio book from the site ""dissuaded"" me from taking my own life, although the effect was short-lived and thoughts of suicide returned again. Sorry for such a long story, or, more precisely, for such long snot.",

1,"Good day, dear guests of the site. I am writing to you hoping for help. I am 25 years old, and my life seems terrible. I'll start from early childhood. I grew up in a dysfunctional, large family. My parent did not have time to study, I did not go to kindergarten. Father constantly I worked, my mother did household chores. At school he was very modest, not talkative., many despised. Until 7-8 grade he studied perfectly well, visited sports clubs. He tried not to be at home, his parents often cursed, he was very afraid. After grade 8 he contacted bad campaign, began to smoke and drink (so as not to be an outcast) Further school, the choice of profession was not conscious. I was also an outcast, but there were friends. I met girls. Next Army, I was also an outcast, because of my lack of confidence and modesty , fear. In the second half of the year, they hung up the stripes. And flew half a year in outfits. Further demobilization. Father took the setting to himself, did not give freedom, like his older brothers. I didn’t think about anything, I went with the flow, I bought a car, built a small house on the same plot as the parent I met girls, made acquaintances in a chat, or they met themselves (there was always a feeling of uncertainty, fear and modesty, there was no opinion) I worked at a construction site mainly with my father, or with acquaintances. At 23 I fell in love with a girl. I tried to get her attention for a year, then gave up, and a week passed since she confessed her love. We met her for a year, all this time I was jealous and afraid of losing her, but I was happy with her. (I also had a feeling of not self-confidence, ) They began to live together for a month. Then she leaves to stay with her mother. Not a big litter on the phone, after which she announced that she did not love me and left. She went to her ex, whom she met three years ago for a long time. less than two months after the quarrel, they played a wedding. After this event, the worldview changed. I understand that I did not live like this, I understand that I do not live like that. But I can’t do anything, my self-esteem has dropped very much. Although it was not there anyway. self-confidence, not my opinion, my brains do not work at all, I go with the flow. I don’t understand how other people talked to me. I understand that people have problems and worse than mine! I understand that all this needs to be overcome, but in front of me it’s like a wall. Thoughts of suecide came, but faith in God stopped, and I’m sorry for my relatives. I don’t see my future. I'm a stupid person. It's very difficult. I don't understand what to do. Sorry, for not formulated text. Help please.",
1,"I'm tired of this life and of how flawed and disgusting I am. I have noticed for a long time that my school ""friends"" for the most part ignore my words and generally have no interest in communicating with me. They are excellent students, they have many other friends, they are authoritative, their teachers love them. And I? I am nobody, absolute and irrevocable zero. I tried so hard to become at least a little necessary, I drew, programmed, wrote stories and short stories, played the guitar, but nothing worked for me. I cannot study normally. Yes, my grades in quarters are more or less normal, only 2-3 triples, but now I am preparing for exams, and there are sheer blockages and, naturally, not a single B. And they? They are excellent students, they are doing well, and they sometimes use all kinds of drugs, but they are still considered better than me. I'm tired, so tired that I no longer have the strength to hold on. I cut myself, beat and tried to die several times, but I am a weakling and nothing works for me. And you can't run away and hide too. How long can you tolerate this? Why should I put up with all this at all? I hate myself, I am not worthy to live in this world, I am disgusting, I must die, but I cannot. Yes, I am an egoist, I understand, but why the hell am I aware of my uselessness in this world? Why should I suffer? Why me and not them?",
1,". Doctors gave me simple schizophrenia. I'm 27. I've been at home for 8 years. It's hard for me to do anything, I can't work. I have no thoughts in my head. I can't even concentrate on watching TV, I'm not interested in anything. Every day there is flour. There are no feelings and emotions. From 15 to 19 I smoked hashish (I always felt bad, hard, there was no thought, I couldn't say anything, I just didn't want to ""break off my friends""), tried DXM several times (as friends) (which I regret so much that I have fear runs all over my body. (but I was in the company, although I was playing basketball)). I believe that everything from drugs (I didn't like them, just for the company., Some kind of dementia began) There were attempts at suicide. Appetite, feelings of sleep, satiety, no urge to use the toilet. There were many strong-willed attempts to pull myself together (I ran 20 kilometers, mowed the lawn, observed fasts, for a year I continuously performed the Jesus prayer for a whole year, throughout the day.) I cannot communicate with people (at the level of yes, no). I can’t concentrate on anything, There are no thoughts in my head (I understand that this is for life and I’m scared), I don’t have feelings for my family, I don’t get pleasure from music, movies (I can’t concentrate). I just lie and smoke all day. There are no emotions, I can not laugh, rejoice. The head is empty. pills don't help. I do not perceive information from outside and I cannot think or empathize about anything. I don't feel the taste of food, impotent. Play computer. games, or watching TV is not perceived, I can not enjoy the Nature, I am very tense. There are no thoughts in my head, and I can’t be distracted by anything. I'm tough. I cannot express my thoughts, which are not there. I cannot relax and perceive the surroundings, and it does not give pleasure. More or less like this. Help as much as you can. I understand that I have lost my life and I am suffering for a long time (this is scary). And so week after week. I can't do anything myself. I can go to the store for cigarettes. I lie all day or walk around the room, I do not perceive TV. It is not interesting to communicate and I cannot. no thoughts. (5 times lay in a psychiatric hospital). Feelings are gone. No love, no joy, no emotional response. From the thoughts of the pictures from the past, I do not understand well what they say on TV (individual words only), I cannot learn anything, I don’t remember. I'm a vegetable. Help as much as you can. I'm very scared and tough.",
