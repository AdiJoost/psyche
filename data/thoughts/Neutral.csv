Work progressed. However, when it was almost complete and was about to open a few days later, a strong lightning struck the bar and it was burnt to the ground. The church folk were rather smug in their outlook after that, till The bar owner sued the church authorities for $2million on the grounds that the church through its congregation & prayers was ultimately responsible For the demise of his bar shop, either through direct or indirect actions or means.
In its reply to the court, the church vehemently denied all responsibility or any connection that their prayers were reasons to the bar shop???s demise. In support of their claim they referred to the Benson study at Harvard that inter-cessionary prayer had no impact !
As the case made its way into court, the judge looked over the paperwork and at the hearing and commented: ???I don???t know how I am going to decide this case, but it appears from the paperwork, we have a bar owner who believes in the power of prayer and we have an entire church and its devotees that doesn???t.???"

Afterwards, you must jump into the lake and the lake will magically transform into the object you had spoken. Good luck!"" The spirit then vanished into thin air.The first guy, already giddy, shouted, ""OHHH! GOOOLLDDD!"" Then ran and jumped into the lake. Instantly, the whole lake is full of yellow legit gold. The first guy swims in the gold lake and after a while, somehow hauls all the gold out of the lake and went home.The second guy, even more ecstatic, yelled, ""OHHHH! DIAMONDS!"" before jumping into the lake. The lake transformed into millions of diamonds in an instant. The second guy happily scoops up all of them.The third guy, bubbling with happiness, could not contain his excitement anymore. He took a few steps back, then proceed to run as fast as could towards the lake.""OHHHHHH..."" he began, but just as he was about to say his desired object, he slipped and fell on a piece of rock.""OH SHIT!"" he cried, as he tumbled into the lake."

The husband, reluctant at first says ""Okay, sounds interesting. Let's give it a shot."" Later that night they head to their local pub.

The bartender replies, ""No way that's a fake eye, you've got a bet."" So, the man takes his eye out, sloshes it around, and puts it back in. The disgruntled bartender holds his end of the bet and gives the man his money. The man says, ""You know what, I feel bad. I tell ya what, double or nothing I can do it with my right eye too."" The bartender replies, ""Deal! You walked right up to me, there's no way your blind!"" But to the bartender's surprise, the man pops out his right eye, sloshes it around, and puts it back in. The bartender, more disgruntled than ever, gives the man his money. The man orders a drink, and goes to interact with the rest of the customers. After a while, the man comes back, and offers the bartender another bet. ""I'll bet you double or nothing that I can piss over the bar and into that cup over there without spilling a drop!"" The bartender agrees, since he knew the man had no eyes. Just like the bartender predicted, the man began pissing on EVERYTHING. All over the bar, himself, the patrons, and the bartender himself. The bartender couldn't help but laugh his ass off. The man gives him the money with a smile, which surprised the bartender. ""Why are you so happy? I just took all your cash!"" ""Simple, I just bet that guy over there $1,000 that I could piss all over you and your bar and make you smile."""

POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.
First guy does, and after a while says ""I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die."" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more.Second guy says ""I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.""

,"A man and woman had been married for more than 60 years. They had shared everything. They had talked about everything. They had kept no secrets from each other except that the little old woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she had cautioned her husband never to open or ask her about. For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, But one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover. In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totaling $95,000. He asked her about the contents. 'When we were to be married,' she said, 'my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.' The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with happiness. 'Honey,' he said, 'that explains the dolls, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?' 'Oh,' she said, 'that's the money I made from selling the dolls.' "

A tractor made of solid gold! Bill knew he had to have it so he picked his best tractor and drove it all the way to the owners house in hopes of buying the magnificent golden tractor.He arrives and speaks to the owner, offering him ??100,000 for the tractor. The man refused, he said the tractor meant far too much to him. Bill then offered the man his entire collection of tractors in exchange for his golden tractor.

,"????????Nobody expected Walter Lynn to walk into the high school reunion in his watermelon costume. Heck, no one thought he was even going to show up, considering how he didn???t show up to his 7th birthday party. He told us at school the next day that he was worried we were going to laugh at him for wearing some stupid birthday cone hat because it wasn???t shaped like a regular hat. Walter was always weird like that; he worried constantly that people judged every move he made, so he always stayed seated and started his homework while the rest of us were letting hell lose whenever the teacher turned his back. He was so boring that even his middle name was ???Meh??ù.  ??????????I mean, he wasn???t a total loser- he was just blander than overcooked chicken. Mr. ???meh??ù never made any jokes cause we might think they were a bust, he never dated anyone because he thought he might be disliked and he never walked out of his house unless it was to get to school or Sunday mass. I remember how we first met: it was back in Sister Adonit???s Kindergarten class and we had to come up and make up a sentence with a word provided by the teacher. For example, I started off the class with the word minor: ???I fell and got a minor cut??ù  ??????????The next person, Ralph Petrucio had the word girl, so he said ???Walter identifies as a girl??ù. Although he got hit with Sister???s sweet meter stick of justice, everyone thought that he was hilarious because he actually did look like a girl. The next person up was Janet, with bicycle. Wanting to follow up Ralph???s joke, ends up saying:  ?????????????Walter is a bisexual??ù  ??????????At this point we might as well have called Kindergarten ???The Roast of Walter Lynn??ù because he was getting redder than the disgusting glop that the lunch ladies kept on insisting was meatloaf. I personally would have done the same if Ralph had came up with the idea before I went up. By the 7th sentence Walter had ran out of the room in tears, leaving behind him a trail that confused our Native American students from the actual one. The day after Sister had forced the class to apologize for acting like ???heathens and pagans??ù, but the damage was already done: he never said another word in class for the next 9 years. We surprisingly became acquaintances because I didn???t think of making fun of him, which I believe was the smartest life choice I???ve ever made. Mr. ???meh??ù always sent me his homework and test answers, resulting in me becoming the salutatorian. After our graduation, Walter claimed he was moving to Britain although someone spotted him hiding in his closet.  ??????????Fastforwarding 20 years, he sent me a message on Facebook asking for the details about the Reunion. I was more surprised by the fact he wanted to come rather than the fact we haven???t spoken in forever. I assumed he was still hiding in his closet.  ??????????So that brings us to the party, where he walked proudly in that fruit suit, catching the hearts of all the single ladies by the punch bar. He mouths towards me a thank you as he goes up and faces his archnemesis Ralph Petrucio.  ??????????Ralph chuckles ???What are you supposed to be, a fruit???ù  ??????????Walter smirks ???Ralph, I have grown up since kindergarten, and I won???t let you dictate who I am. From now on, I???m not going to identify as a girl or a bisexual. I wear this suit as I come out of the closet to pronounce that I identify as a Walter Meh Lynn!??ù"

The three men get out to see what the problem is only to find out the engine block cracked so they agree that they have to go find help and to meet back at the car by nightfall.
They all go to the trunk of the car to see if they have any provisions for their walk and find a jug of water and a loaf of bread. 
The first man quickly grabs the jug of water explaining to the other two that if he gets hot he'll just drink some water and keep walking until he finds help and starts to go on his way.
The second man grabs the bread and explains to his friend that if he gets hungry on his journey that he'll just eat some bread and keep walking until he finds help and leaves going a different direction.
The third man is left alone and realizes he has nothing to help him survive the desert so he unbolts the car door and starts walking into the desert in a different direction from the first two.
A hour or so later a desert soldier who was on patrol noticed the first man and asked him if he was ok. The first man explained his situation and assured the soldier that he was ok because if he got hot he could just drink his water. The soldier pointed in a direction and told him to head to his headquarters for help while he searched for the mans friends and headed out again.
A couple of hours later he found the second man still searching for help. The soldier asked him if he was ok and the second man told him he was because he had his bread to eat whenever he got hungry. The soldier explained that he found the first man and to start heading toward the car as help would soon arrive and headed out again to try and find the third man.
The soldier found the third man in no time but was confused as to why he was carrying the car door. When the soldier asked the man why he casually explained that it gets really hot in the desert and if he gets too hot he can just roll down the window to cool off."

""Ah, I'll give 'em to the pet store. Somebody else's problem.""
Well this just would not do for this church-going woman, so she offered to take the bird off the young man's hands. He insisted, ""Ah no, Miss Wainwright, you don't want this old bird! He used to belong to my father before he passed, and he's got a real mouth on him."" 
Gladys insisted right back and sealed the deal with saying how lonely she would be without him to help her with the gardening. The young man relented, shaking his head, and thinking to himself that he had warned her before passing the cage off.The bird was quiet the first night, and Gladys figured that all the bird really needed was to get away from those loud video games. 
The next morning she awoke and walked downstairs to the kitchen, passing the cage on the way. 
""HEY OLD BITCH! WHERE THE HELL'S MY FUCKIN' FOOD?"" The parrot screeched at her.
Shocked, she turned slowly on the spot to stare at him. And then she spoke, ""Now I don't know what you got up to next door, but that just won't be tolerated here!""
""FUCK YOU, DRIED UP OLD CUNT!"" 
Gladys snatched the bird out of the cage and carried him to the kitchen, ignoring his loud curses and wing flapping. She held him up and said to his beak, ""You need to be taught some manners! You sit in here and think about your language, birdy!""
She popped him in the freezer and turned away to make some tea. 
When the kettle had boiled a minute later, she opened the freezer to reveal a shuddering parrot that was glaring at her, but saying nothing. Smiling in a satisfied way, she removed him and placed him back in his cage. 
The next morning, Gladys totters down the steps and coos, ""Good morning my pretty little birdy!""""AH, FUCK THIS! YOU CAN SUCK MY FEATHERY COCK LADY!"" Gladys promptly popped the bird in the freezer again, but this time while boiling the kettle her daughter called. By the time she had gotten off the phone with her third grandchild, she realized she had quite forgotten the bird.
Hustling back over to the freezer as fast as her rheumatism would allow, she wrenched open the door and found her bird alive, nearly frozen. As she removed him the bird said in a small voice, ""Alright lady, I'm real sorry... But I gotta ask.. What the HELL did that turkey say?"""

,"So, a guy with a small monkey on his shoulder walks into a bar,  the bartender isn't too thrilled about an animal being in a bar,  but he says nothing deciding to see if it's behaving first. Guy orders a drink and the monkey is just sitting there watching someone play pool. All of a sudden the monkey jumps on to the pool table,  grabs one of the billiards and swallows it. The bartender gets pissed off and tells at the guy to get his damn monkey out of there. Guy apologises and leaves. About a week later,  same guy with same monkey walks back in,  but this time the monkey is on a leash. Bartender is keeping a close eye on the monkey,  to make sure it doesn't try any more monkey business. Monkey is on its best behaviour,  just sitting there,  then it spots some grapes on the table, it grabs a single grape, looks at it then shoves it up is own ass, pulls it back out and eats it. ""What the hell is that disgusting monkey doing?!?"" Yells the surprised bartender. ""Oh that?"" Says the guy, ""After the trouble that billiard ball gave him on the way out,  he now measures everything first before eating it."""

,"Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday! "", and possibly have a present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. My kids came in to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!"" We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment."" After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back."" ""Ok."" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... Followed by my wife, kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"". And I just sat there... On the couch... In my birthday suit."

,"...they meet at the club get to the first tee. St Peter sets down his ball and swings. Its a good shot, and he lands the ball  short of the green.""Your turn."" He says to Jesus. Jesus carefully sets down his ball. He takes a good long look down the fairway, gets into position, wiggles his hips, and swings. The ball flies straight up into the air, hits a plane, comes straight back down, bounces off the tee, across to the lake, off a frog's head, off a lily pad, and back onto the fairway. The ball rolls at lightning speed up towards the green, across the green, and then immediately stops 1 inch from the hole. Then a gust of wind blows it into the hole.St Peter turns to Jesus and says, ""Look are you gonna play golf or are you just gonna fuck around?"""

,"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' `A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. `Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. You've made me very happy yet again.' That night, the son spent on board the tanker. The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' `Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.The son nodded weakly. The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. `I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. `I- I-' Then he died. "

When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.
After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Miami Dolphins, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.Edit: seriously just now saw it was posted on .

A long journey took him across plains, he had to climb dangerous mountains, sail across perilous seas, and even fly over a river of lava, flowing from a volcano that hasn't died in years and years.
Suddenly, he spots rainfall coming from one spot, coming from infinity, but curving as it nears the land.

He thinks, ""huh, this isn't so bad"".The man again manages to cut off the rope and free himself, at which time he hears the Chinese man walking up the stairs.
